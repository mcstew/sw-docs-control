# Setting up your story

good news: You don't have to stress out about your brain dump. You can put absolutely anything you want in this field, but here are a few pointers on what you may want to include to get the most out of it:.

## Braindump

Imagine that you’re meeting with another writer who will collaborate with you on your story.

You’re meeting them for the first time, and they have zero context. The Braindump section is what you’d tell this writer in order to introduce them to the core elements on your story. It’s part elevator pitch, part “everything I know for sure.”

This could be a sentence, a paragraph, a snippet of a scene, or any free-form passage of text. The more information you put in Braindump, the better picture the AI will have of your vision.

**We recommend writing at least a few hundred words here**. You can always revise Braindump later as story elements change.

<aside>
🧠 Braindump directly influences the generation of Synopsis. Otherwise, if the Synopsis is never filled in or generated, fields that are typically informed by Synopsis will defer to the Braindump.
