# Visibility Settings

### What if I want to hide something from the AI?

Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just hover over the Character card and click on the eyeball icon that appears to toggle off the AI visibility.

**When the visibility of a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait is toggled off, Sudowrite’s AI will ignore it altogether.**

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine *may* consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. To hide the Motive from Sudowrite, toggle the visibility setting within the Motive trait field from the eyeball icon in the upper right.

Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and their traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.

⚠️

Remember that hiding a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait from Sudowrite will hide it from all AI features. That means features like Chat, Write, and even Plugins will think it doesn’t exist (because they can’t see it).
