# Visualize

Visualize is a feature that brings your writing to life by generating images based on your text. Whether you're describing a character, setting a scene, or painting a vivid landscape with your words, Visualize transforms your descriptions into beautiful images—giving you a new perspective on your work.

### How to use Visualize

Visualize appears in the **More Tools** dropdown menu when you have text selected in your document. To use it, just select a passage of text (minimum 10 words, maximum 500) that contains descriptive content, click on More Tools and select **Visualize** from the list. Like other features, the AI will create a card in your History column on the right where you can see your results.

Once that image appears, you can click Insert to insert it directly into your document wherever your cursor is, Favorite it for future reference, or just right click and save it to your computer.

**ICYMI:** Visualize only appears when you have text selected. Make sure your selection contains enough descriptive detail (at least 10 words) for the best results. Visualize works on up to a 500 word selection.

### What Does Visualize See?

Visualize looks first and foremost at the text that you’ve selected—but to improve your results, it will now also look at your Story Bible’s Character section if the operative passage mentions specific characters. Visualize tries to make sure that the images that it is generating match the Physical Description trait fields for any mentioned characters (though it will look at the *entire* character card for broader context if a Physical Description trait is not detected).

### For best results from Visualize

The quality of your generated images depends a bit on the detail in your text. Here are some tips:

- **Be specific:** Include colors, textures, lighting, and other visual details
- **Set the scene:** Describe the environment and atmosphere
- **Focus on the most important elements:** What do you want to stand out?
- **Keep it cohesive:** Conflicting descriptions might result in unusual images

For example, instead of:
"A castle on a hill."

Try:
"A gothic stone castle perched on a misty green hill, its dark spires piercing the dawn sky, with stained glass windows glinting in the morning light."

Essentially, use the same descriptive language you’d use when trying to conjure an image in your reader’s mind for best results.
