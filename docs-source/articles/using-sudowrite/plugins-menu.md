## Plugin Menus

<Description>

A plugin menu is a user interface element that provides access to additional features and functionality through third-party extensions. These menus typically appear in the application's main interface and allow users to interact with plugin features seamlessly.

Key aspects of plugin menus include:

- Organization: Menus should be logically structured and easy to navigate
- Accessibility: Clear labeling and keyboard shortcuts for essential functions
- Integration: Seamless blending with the main application's interface
- Customization: Options to enable/disable specific plugin features

Best practices for implementing plugin menus:

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related functions together
- Provide clear documentation for each plugin feature
- Include tooltips or help text for complex functions
