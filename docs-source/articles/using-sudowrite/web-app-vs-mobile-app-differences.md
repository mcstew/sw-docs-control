# Web App vs. Mobile App Differences

Last Updated: January 12, 2026
Published: Yes
Suggested: No

## Mobile vs. Web App

While the mobile app was originally intended to be a **companion app** to the full web app, it can be used exclusively if desired. The key principle: if you have a full keyboard at a desk, you definitely have more features available and AI options via the web app. For everything else (walks, trains, capturing ideas on the go), use the mobile app.

### Feature Differences

**Web App:**

- Full suite of features, including Story Bible’s generation tools
- 4-5 different ways to accomplish most tasks
- Access to the entire Plugins ecosystem
- Document History and (Project and Document) Trash access

**Mobile App:**

- Streamlined, simplified interface
- Typically 2 ways to accomplish tasks (use the feature or ask chat)
- Four core features: Write, Rewrite, Chat, and Smart Dictation
- Story Bible access—generations limited to the Chat workflow
- No Trash or Document History access (must use web to recover deleted items)
