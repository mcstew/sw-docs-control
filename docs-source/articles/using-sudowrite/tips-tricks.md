# Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting

## Three Steps to Awesome Prose

1️⃣ **Make it your own**

Modify the outputs you get from Story Bible to make them your own and express your unique voice. You’ll probably spot a few things in each section that don’t track with your vision. Take every chance to express your own ideas and you’ll be surprised how much Story Bible will begin to channel your sensibilities!

2️⃣ **Keep it up to date**

As you progress through Story Bible, details about your story will likely change. For example, your characters may evolve, the setting might shift, or you might change the ending. Keeping all of the Story Bible sections up to date will make sure that Sudowrite doesn’t get confused as things change.

3️⃣ **You decide what’s important**

One of the creative choices you make in writing with Story Bible is deciding what information you emphasize to your junior writing partner. You might value Characters most and focus on characterization and arc. Or you might prioritize setting, or dialogue. Experiment with different emphases in your Scenes, Style, and elsewhere and see what works best for you.

## The Three Horsemen of Bad Prose

❌ **Vagueness**

Replace any vagueness with specific ideas. Otherwise, Story Bible will fill in the gaps—that's an opportunity for it to either delight or disappoint you; It won't always delight you!

Generate stronger prose through **specificity**.

❌ **Conflicting information**

If Sudowrite sees conflicting information or instructions across sections of your Story Bible or documents, it may get confused and write something that doesn’t make sense. To avoid this, **make sure all your sections are consistent and delete anything out of date.**

<aside>
✏️ **Example**

Story Bible looks at prior sections to generate the current section. For example, Prose Generation looks at Style, Characters, and Scenes, so if you define a character as *”dreams to become a baker one day”* but you have a Scene that says *”decides to quit being a baker”*, Story Bible might be confused. 

Which is it? Does this character want to be a baker or not!?

To fix the inconsistency, update the character descriptions to reflect your character at the point of time in the story you’re currently writing.

</aside>

In short, generate stronger prose through **consistency**.

❌ **Confusing wording**

Sometimes we write something down that’s obvious to *us* but might be confusing to AI. When this happens, Story Bible might write something that is actually reasonable if you read carefully, but appears totally ridiculous on first blush. Try to **be precise in your wording and look for ambiguities** in each section to avoid this

<aside>
✏️ **Example**

You have a Scene that includes:

*"Joey tries to tell Suzie that there’s nothing wrong, but Suzie knows what he did".*

To you this may be obvious. After all, in Chapter 2, Joey accidentally ran over the neighbor’s dog and buried it in the woods, but when drafting Prose, Story Bible only looks at Style, Characters, and Scenes, so it doesn’t know what happened in Chapter 2 unless you choose to link prior documents. In this case, Story Bible doesn’t know what *”what he did”* refers to.

To fix this, you could be more precise and write:

*”Suzie knows that he killed and buried the neighbor’s dog secretly”* as part of the Scene.

</aside>

In short, generate stronger prose through **clarity**.

There’s almost always a rational explanation for any mistake Story Bible makes. As Sherlock Holmes says in *The Hound of the Baskervilles*, “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.” 

Channel your inner Sherlock, and you’ll get back on track in no time.
