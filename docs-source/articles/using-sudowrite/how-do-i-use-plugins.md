# How do I use Plugins?

## Finding Plugins

The Plugins Directory is available under the **More Tools** dropdown menu in your toolbar.

## Adding Plugins

The Plugins Directory page lists all of the available Plugins.

The Plugins Directory, with featured Plugin cards pictured up top.

You can select Categories along the left to view Plugins according to their category, and you can use the filter views available to sort by Popular (most installed) or Newest (most recently published). Note that you also have filter views available for Plugins you’ve added or built.

To add a plugin, just click the **Add** button on the Plugin’s info card. You can also click into the card to visit the Plugin’s detailed description page and read more about it, before choosing to **Add** it from there.

An example of the Plugin Description page.

The Description page includes details on the creator, how many users it has, an estimation of how many credits it might use, and a Description written by the creator. The Description should give you a good idea of what the Plugin is intended to do, and ideally how to use it.

Some creators may choose to make their Plugin **Instructions** visible, and if they’ve done so, those will appear on this page as well. Instructions are essentially the AI System and User prompt that is shared with the AI model they selected to power their plugin.

In the upper right, you’ll see a **Copy Link** button (if you’d like to share the Plugin) and an Add button, which will install it. To use the Plugin, you’ll have to click **Add**. (You’ll also see an Edit button if it’s one of your Plugins.)

Once you’ve added a Plugin, you will see it available in all of your projects under the **More Tools** dropdown in the top right of your toolbar.

To use a Plugin, just select it from this dropdown.

💡

Select **Reorder this Menu** from the **More Tools** dropdown to rearrange that dropdown list. You can even move your most frequently-used Plugins to your actual Toolbar, replacing features like Write and Rewrite!

**Take note: The Plugins you install may work in one of many different ways.** They may require you to highlight text, or put your cursor somewhere in particular, or even write something in a field that will appear on click. Some Plugins might even ask you to structure the text in your document in a particular way, or write specific text (sometimes in a specific format) and highlight *that*. It’s important to familiarize yourself with how an installed Plugin works (again, on the Description page) before using it in order to achieve the best results.

Plugins output to the History column on the right, just like other Sudowrite features. And just like with those features, you can favorite, insert, and copy these cards as desired.
