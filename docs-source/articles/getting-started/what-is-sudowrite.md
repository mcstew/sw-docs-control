Sudowrite is an AI toolkit for novelists that will help you plan, write, edit, and organize your work. It can offer suggestions, enhance prose, facilitate brainstorming and much, much more. You can focus on the parts of the writing process that you love, and get help from the AI with everything else.

When getting started on Sudowrite, you can spin up a Story Bible from your notes, or use the Import tools to bring in a work-in-progress or finished book (in case you’d like to write the sequel). Here’s a video that quickly runs down some of what Sudowrite is capable of.

    Sudowrite is the AI writing partner of your dreams, full of tools that help you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page.
    
    Whether you want to start a new project or bring in a half-finished work, you can use Sudowrite for every step of your writing process—from brainstorming and planning to writing, editing, and beyond.
    
    Use the Brainstorm tools to generate and collect fresh ideas, or just pop open chat to discuss your story.
    
    Throw your unstructured ideas into Story Bible’s Braindump section and gradually expand that into a fully developed outline. Fill out these boxes manually, let Sudowrite do it for you, or collaborate with the AI.
    
    With your Story Bible complete, you can generate Scenes, and after making sure they reflect your vision, turn those into full chapters of prose using the Chapter Generator.
    
    If you’re more of a pantser than a plotter, use the Write button to get unstuck with inspired suggestions. And then use Expand to flesh things out, or Describe to add rich sensory details.
    
    Finally, use Rewrite to dial in your voice—or Quick Edit to transform your prose according to  specific instructions.
    
    When you’re done, you can even find Plugins that will help you write a query letter—so you can line up an agent to help you sell your masterpiece.
    
    Planning, writing, revising, editing… No matter where you could use support in your writing process, Sudowrite is there for you. Try it today for free at [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com/)
