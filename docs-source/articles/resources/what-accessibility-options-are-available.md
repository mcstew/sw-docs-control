# What accessibility options are available?

Last Updated: March 22, 2024
Published: Yes
Suggested: No

We think that every writer should be empowered to tell their story, so there are a handful of features on Sudowrite intended to help make that possible.

First, Sudowrite’s Settings (⚙️) include a number of accessibility options. One of those is the OpenDyslexic font which is intended to reduce some of the more common reading errors associated with dyslexia. Another is our Themes, which is how and where you would enable Dark Mode (try *Charcoal* for that)—but Themes also provide a range of color palettes so you can select something that works best for your vision.

We’ve also recently made some big improvements to the way that Sudowrite works with screen readers—so if you’re a screen reader user, you should now have an easier time navigating Sudowrite

While not *explicitly* an accessibility tool, several users have flagged that Plugins—our versatile build-your-own-AI-feature toolkit—have improved their Sudowrite experience. There are even tools such as the [Disability sensitivity reader](https://www.sudowrite.com/app/plugin/j3dQ5j6Ia/sensitivity-reader-disability) that have been built as a result.

For more on accessibility, we’d recommend connecting with other members of our community—especially our Ambassadors—in the Sudowrite community Discord server here: [https://discord.gg/sudowrite](https://discord.gg/sudowrite). And for feature requests in particular, you can flag those to our attention in the Discord, use [our feedback board here](https://feedback.sudowrite.com/), or email us at: hi@sudowrite.com.
