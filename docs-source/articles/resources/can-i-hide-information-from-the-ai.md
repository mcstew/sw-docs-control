# Can I hide information from the AI?

Last Updated: June 17, 2024
Published: Yes
Suggested: No

Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just click the three dots (•••) in the upper right corner of the Character card to toggle the visibility settings of that character to Never.

**When visibility is set to Never, Sudowrite’s AI will ignore that card or trait altogether.**

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character Card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine *may* consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. To hide the Motive from Sudowrite’s AI, toggle the visibility setting from within the Motive trait field from *Use: Automatically* to *Never*.

Click the Use: Automatically drop down from within the trait field to set that trait’s visibility.

When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the visbility of a trait is set to Never and Sudowrite will ignore it.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.
