# What are credits?

Each Sudowrite plan tier receives a set amount of credits each month, and those credits are then used towards Sudowrite’s AI features.

Think of credits like arcade tokens. You’ll redeem some credits each time you use an AI feature—exactly *how many* credits depends entirely on what you’re doing, just like some arcade games use a single token while the air hockey table uses a fist full. When it comes to Sudowrite, the number of credits used depends on the complexity of a task (which means the number of words read, words written, and the AI model doing the work).

All this means is **there’s no 1:1 relationship between the words you generate and the number of credits used**. By way of an example, the 1 million credits of the Professional plan might allow you to generate anywhere from 50,000 to 500,000 AI words in a month (depending entirely on how you go about it).
