    You are currently on the **sub collection page** of your HelpKit knowledge base. You **don't** have to connect this page with HelpKit. The only page you have to connect with HelpKit is your **root page** *(where all your main collections are listed)* ****during your [onboarding](https://support.helpkit.so/Getting-Started/1j4YCz4dwuBqHKe8pYAGVd/Three-easy-steps-to-setup-HelpKit/mg8xRqHqFDYcfVW8K7SKEn). 
    
    The **`Sub Collections Tables`** below stores all of your knowledge base articles. The idea is that you use these to visually separate your help articles into separate sub collections so that your customers can easily find the article they are looking for.
    
    Feel free to override the preexisting sub collection title as well as the article title and descriptions with your own content.

        1. Click on the **`+ New`** button and fill out the required fields
        2. Start writing your article
    - **↕️ Rearranging articles:**
        1. Use drag and drop to move your articles to your desired position
    - ➕ **Adding a new sub collection:**

        2. Click on the settings button `...` ****of this table

    In order to serve your customers the fastest knowledge base on earth 🌍 we cache most of the data. This means that you have to press the **`🔁 Sync now`** button in your admin dashboard whenever you change the structure of your knowledge base i.e collection/article title and description, article properties such as *published* or the article itself. 
    
    You can also **resync** each article individually to quickly get an update published.
