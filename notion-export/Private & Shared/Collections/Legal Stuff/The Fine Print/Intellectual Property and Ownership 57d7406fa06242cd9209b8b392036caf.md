### Ownership Rights

We understand it's super important for you to retain ownership over the content you create, so whether you use Sudowrite to brainstorm, enhance your ideas, or fine-tune your writing, all the writing you generate remains yours. When you input text into Sudowrite and use its features to generate or improve content, the output is based on your initial input and creative direction. This means that the resulting content, enriched or transformed by Sudowrite, is considered your intellectual property. You have initiated the creative process, and therefore, the contributions made by Sudowrite in response to your inputs are yours to own, use, and distribute as you see fit.

### Plagiarism

You may have heard of concerns regarding plagiarism where AI is concerned. Sudowrite won't plagiarize unless you *force it* to plagiarize, which is against our Terms of Service.

AI works by guessing one word at a time, based on general concepts it has learned from billions of samples of text. That means it's *extremely unlikely* to produce the same words verbatim, or even ever again. It does not copy and paste chunks of text, it guesses each word—technically, *parts* of words—one at a time.

The only way to potentially get unoriginal content out of Sudowrite is to use text the AI has seen a lot before verbatim, like the lyrics of a popular song, or the first paragraph of an extremely popular book like Harry Potter. As long as your input is original, you'll get original writing out of Sudowrite. Of course, we encourage you to try plagiarism checkers to verify your results.
