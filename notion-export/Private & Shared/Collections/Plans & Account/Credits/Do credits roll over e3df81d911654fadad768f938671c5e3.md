Only credits on the **Max** plan will roll over. Otherwise, unused credits expire at the end of each monthly refresh cycle on both the **Hobby & Student** and **Professional** plans.

For example, if you signed up for a Professional plan at 2:02pm ET on the 5th of February, unused credits will expire and new credits will be added on the 5th of each month at 2:02pm ET.

If, on the other hand, you signed up on the 31st, on months where there is no 31st day, your billing cycle ends on the last day of the month.

Rollover credits are reserved for **Max** plan subscribers. As long as you maintain an active subscription on the Max plan, your unused credits do not expire monthly and will instead roll over for up to 12 months from date of issue.

There is actually one other exception to credits expiring, and that’s *purchased* credits on any plan*.* If you run out of credits *before* your monthly refresh, you do have the option of purchasing more. Purchased credits never expire, and will remain on your account indefinitely in case you exhaust your monthly allotment again in the future.
