For security purposes, we do not currently authenticate accounts with passwords. Instead, we use passwordless authentication, which is accomplished via an emailed magic link. It means that only the holder of the email account will ever be able to access your Sudowrite account.

We do, however, support other login methods like logging in via Google! If you like, you can click "Log in with Google" via the login screen, and this will allow you to enter Sudowrite without checking your email for that magic link.
