# Can I use Sudowrite in other languages?

You can write text in almost any language, and Sudowrite’s Write button will (usually!) automatically match your language in its suggestions. When using other features, like the Draft tool or Plugins, you may have found that Sudowrite sometimes falls back on English.

While there's currently no single "Language" setting for your Sudowrite account, Sudowrite users all around the world have managed to get the tool to consistently generate prose in languages like German, Italian, French, Danish, and more. One way to do so is by simply including a line in your instructions—whether that’s the Plugin prompt field, the Extra Instructions field, or even just in your document/highlight—that says `[Write all output in X]` *in* your preferred language.

If you’re looking for other tips on how to get Sudowrite to consistently write in your preferred language, you should join our community Discord server and ask folks in the Multilingual channel for their advice!
