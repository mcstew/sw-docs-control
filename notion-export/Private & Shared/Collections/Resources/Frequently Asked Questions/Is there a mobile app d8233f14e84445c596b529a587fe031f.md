Yes! Sudowrite has a mobile app available on both iOS and Android. The mobile app is intended to be a companion app, and as such is a bit different from the web app—certain familiar features like Write and Rewrite are available, but other features are unavailable. Instead, the app is focused on Smart Dictation (and Smart Dictation Enhancement) and an enriched Chat experience.

You can find the app in the iOS App Store or the Google Play Store, and learn more about using it right here: [Mobile App Overview](../../Using%20Sudowrite/Sudowrite%E2%80%99s%20Mobile%20App/Mobile%20App%20Overview%201ea7975fa0ec800cbf78e8ffcb4d3b2c.md)
