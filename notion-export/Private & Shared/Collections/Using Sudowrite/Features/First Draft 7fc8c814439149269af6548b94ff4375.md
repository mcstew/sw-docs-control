First Draft is a feature that helps you get the ball rolling when you don’t know where to begin. Whether you’re working on a novel, blog post, article, or essay, First Draft will generate up to **3000 words** based on a prompt you provide—giving you a solid jumping-off point to work from.

It’s intended for that early, idea-spark moment, before you’ve written anything in the document. It’s actually a great way to develop a thin concept into a substantial Brandump so you can get started with Story Bible. First Draft offers a foundation that you can then edit, refine, or build on.

## How to use First Draft

**First Draft is only useable when your document is completely empty.** Here’s how to find it:

1. **Open a blank document** inside any Sudowrite project.
2. Click on the **More Tools** dropdown in the toolbar.
3. Select **First Draft** from the list.

You’ll see a field appear with some example prompts to inspire you below. Just complete that field and click Go!

**ICYMI:** First Draft is only useable in totally blank documents. It will appear greyed-out in the More Tools dropdown menu if you’re working in a document that you’ve already written in.

### For best results from First Draft

The more detail you provide, the better the draft will be. Here are a few tips:

- **Fiction?** Include character names, settings, and key events.
- **Non-fiction?** Share the structure or argument you want to make.
- **Something else?** Mention tone, style, or any specific quirks you’d like to see.

We recommend giving as much detail as you can here. A sentence or two is fine, but a full paragraph is better. As you type, First Draft gives you feedback on how to improve your prompt—think of it as a writing coach guiding you toward a stronger start.

## What you can expect from First Draft

Once you submit your prompt, Sudowrite will stream a first draft directly into the editor. The draft is:

- Tailored to the type of content you asked for (fiction or non-fiction)
- Inserted as regular text, ready for immediate editing
- Generated with beautiful sparkles—so you can follow along as it appears!

Whether it’s a moody short story opening or a structured blog article, First Draft gives you something real to react to.

## When you should use it

First Draft is perfect if you:

- Don’t know how to start your story or essay
- Want a quick spark of inspiration
- Prefer editing and shaping over generating from scratch
- Need to experiment with tone, structure, or POV without starting from zero

Some common use cases include:

- Fiction scenes and character intros
- Personal essays or blog entries
- Opinion pieces or structured arguments
- Genre-specific prompts like thrillers, romance, or historical fiction
