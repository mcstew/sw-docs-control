Ever wish it was easier to make prose sound more like *you*?

**My Voice lets you train a private, custom model on your work so that Sudowrite can instantly rewrite anything in your voice.** It works like magic, whether what you’re transforming was originally written by the AI or a human writing partner.

✌️ There are two simple steps to using My Voice.

1. Train a custom My Voice on some existing work.
2. Use that My Voice model to restyle prose.

---

## What you’ll need to create a My Voice model

- **Existing work:** Have a **sample of your own, human-written text** ready to go. It should be representative of the style you’re looking to replicate.
- **Sample criteria:** Minimum of **1,000 words** with no upper limit. The sample *quality* is the most important consideration.
- **File types:** Upload a `.txt` file **or** just copy/paste text directly into the modal.

⚠️

**Important note**

Avoid using AI-generated text as your training data; it can reduce the quality of the resulting model.

## How to train your My Voice model

1. Head to Sudowrite and **open any document.**
2. In the bottom of the left sidebar, click **My Voice**—or [just click right here](https://editor.sudowrite.com/app/my-voice).
3. Click **Train New My Voice**.
4. Choose one:
    - **Upload** a `.txt` file, or
    - **Paste** your sample into the text box.
5. Click **Start training**. Training typically takes less than **2 minutes**.
6. When training finishes, you’re returned to the My Voice model list, where your new voice appears.
    - By default, it’s named after your file (or the first part of pasted text).
    - To rename it, open the **More (⋯) menu** next to the model and choose **Rename**. This is also where you’ll delete a voice.

## Use your voice to revise text

Think of My Voice primarily as an **editing** tool that helps you take a first draft to second, third, and beyond.

1. **Open your project** and highlight the text you want to transform
    - You can select **short snippets** or **large sections** (up to **4,000 words**).
2. Select **My Voice** in the Selection Menu that appears to rewrite the highlighted prose in the selected style.
    1. Alternatively, click the down arrow (⌄) next to **My Voice** and choose your preferred model (e.g., *Regency style*). Your most-recently selected model will persist.
3. A card will appear in the History section on the right with your rewritten prose.

## Controlling the My Voice intensity

You may find that the first time you use My Voice to rewrite a passage, the style is either too subtle or too pronounced for your liking. Fortunately, you can easily change the intensity of a My Voice rewrite. To do so, simply tweak the **Creativity** slider in your **Write Settings**. (You can find the Write Settings beneath the down arrow next to the Write button in the top toolbar.)

- **Lower Creativity** → lighter edits, less apparent style, closer to the source.
- **Higher Creativity** → stronger more pronounced rewrites with more stylistic change.

**Recommended workflow:** Start near the middle, then adjust up or down based on your preference.

**Tips & best practices**

- **Match POV & tense:** Train with samples in the **same point of view and tense** as your target work for most predictable results.
- **Selection length ↔ style strength:**
    - On **short selections**, **high** Creativity may cause the model to **expand** more than you want. If it overwrites or “keeps going,” **lower** your Creativity.
    - On **long selections** (approaching 4,000 words), you may need to **raise** Creativity to see sufficient stylistic impact.
- **Iterate to intensify style:** For extra impact, copy the rewritten prose from your My Voice card in the History section, paste it back into your draft, and **run My Voice on it again** for a second pass.

## What else to know

- My Voices are stored privately in your Sudowrite account, accessible only to you. **They are not project-specific**, however, which means you can use any My Voice you train in any of your projects.

## Troubleshooting

- **“It didn’t change much.”**
    - Increase **Creativity** or select a longer passage. Ensure your training sample is strong and representative.
- **“It changed too much / kept writing past my selection.”**
    - Lower **Creativity** and select a slightly longer span for more context.
- **“Results feel off.”**
    - Check that your training sample matches your project’s **POV and tense**, and avoid AI-generated training text.
