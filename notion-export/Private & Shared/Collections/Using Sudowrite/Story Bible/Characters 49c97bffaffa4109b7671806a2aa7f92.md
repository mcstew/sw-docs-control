## Characters

The Characters section is where you define the characters in your story. This affects how the characters are described, how their dialogue is written, what choices they make, and how they interact with each other. Once you’ve completed your synopsis, Story Bible can create all of your characters for you.

**To tell Story Bible to create your Characters, click the Generate All Characters button.**

When you generate characters, Story Bible will take what you’ve written in your Synopsis and use it to generate the main characters in your story. Characters explicitly mentioned in your Synopsis will automatically be included. If you don’t mention any specific characters in your Synopsis, or if you only mention a few, Story Bible will create additional characters for your consideration. You can leave these characters as-is, or ideally, change the substance of their character cards.

🧠 Characters are generated based on the Synopsis. Meanwhile, the Characters section directly influences the generation of your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

### Character Cards

**Each character receives their own card in the Characters section of your Story Bible.**

Cards are how you keep track of each individual character and their details. Cards can be collapsed with the arrow next to the characters name, and dragged to your preferred order with the six-dot handle in the upper left.

The dropdown in the upper right allows you to set a Characters role (for example, protagonist, supporting character, etc.). You can see previous versions of the character in the card history—accessed from the clock icon up top—and you can delete a character card using the three dots on the right.

By default, each Character card created includes the following traits: Pronouns, Groups, Other Names, Personality, Background, Physical Description, and Dialogue Style.

### Adding Characters

There are three ways to add characters. Click **+ Add Character** in the Characters header section of Story Bible, and choose from:

**Blank Character -** This creates a blank character card (with either the default traits, or the custom defaults you’ve assigned) for you to manually complete.

**Generate Character** - This option opens a small prompt window that allows you to ask for a certain *type* of character. This field is very flexible, and you can be as vague or as specific as you’d like.

**Try this:** Ask for a mentor character, or an antagonist to your existing protagonist, in the Generate Character box. You can even paste a lengthy character braindump here for a character you already have notes on. Sudowrite’s AI will further develop the character based on your notes, and refine it so that it fits your default card traits.

**Surprise Me** - This option will instantly generate a random character to round out your cast. Your existing Characters and storyline are taken into consideration and the AI will try to create something that compliments the existing cast.
You can add or generate as many characters as you’d like.

### Character Traits

Most of the default traits are pretty self-explanatory. Personality, Background, Physical Description, and Dialogue Style all help an author distinguish characters from one another and add richer detail to their writing.

But traits are there both for *your* reference, *and* that of the AI. **Traits inform how the AI will write a character anywhere that character appears.** And since AI depends on specificity, some traits are *primarily* for the benefit of the AI.

If your character belongs to a group—say for example that they’re in a D&D group called The Hellfire Club—you’d want to include that group name under **Groups**. That way, if you reference The Hellfire Club in a scene, the AI knows which characters may be involved.

The same goes for **Other Names**. Be sure to include any of your character’s nicknames, pet names, or pseudonyms in Other Names, so that the AI understands who you’re referring to at all times (—for example, when you write Tommy in Chapter 6 and you’re actually referring to the character card for Thomas Culligan).

### Trait Customization

Traits aren’t set in stone. You can retitle existing traits, or even **create custom traits at the individual character level *or* at the default level**.

**Need to add a one-off trait to a character?** (For example, maybe you need a “Bat Form Physical Description” for your vampiric protagonist.) Just click **+ Add Trait** at the bottom of that character card, title the trait, and then fill out the empty field with details.

**Want all of your characters—or even a specific character type—to have additional traits?** Click the **Customize** button under the **More menu (•••)** at the top of the Characters section and you can edit and rearrange your default traits for each Character type. You can even create brand new custom Character types with specific trait sets!

![CleanShot 2026-01-13 at 18.24.17@2x.png](../../../../Sudowrite/464bbb10ed2c49c49d13490fb9c423e4/Public%20Docs/Story%20Bible%20Guide/CleanShot_2026-01-13_at_18.24.172x.png)

Just click **+ Add** to add a new default trait, and all future characters will be created with that default trait included. This is ideal if you’d like to add your characters’ Enneagram types, core wounds, or story-specific details (like shifter form, for example).

When adding new defaults, you have the option to create fields for those traits across all existing characters. Just note that if you choose to add them on every existing character card, the newly created fields will need to be manually filled out. Freshly-generated characters on the other hand will include the updated defaults, with those trait fields populated on generation.

### Generating Traits

After adding new default traits to pre-existing Character cards or Worldbuilding elements, you may wind up with a bunch of empty trait fields. Traits can always be filled in manually, but sometimes you want the AI’s help with that, so you have the ability to generate traits individually as well.

**When a trait field is empty, just put your cursor inside of the field and click *Generate*.** You’ll have the option to provide custom instructions, but you can also just click ***Go***. The AI will then populate that trait field with something contextually appropriate.

The AI takes the rest of your Characters, Worldbuilding elements, and Story Bible context into consideration when generating those traits individually.

You also have the option to Rewrite trait fields that you’re not satisfied with. Just **click Rewrite from within the trait field**, provide custom instructions (if desired), and click Go. The AI looks at the current version of the trait, then rewrites it either according to provide instructions or (if blank) its own intuition and context.

### Character Data

Story Bible’s updated characters section has more structured character data than ever. But **which of Sudowrite’s features make use of your Character data**?

Your characters section is referenced by the Draft tool for the creation of both Scenes and prose generation. Characters are also referenced by the Write button’s Auto and Guided Write modes. And both Quick Edit and Chat can see your characters as well—try asking Chat about any of your character details.

![CleanShot 2026-01-14 at 12.23.42.png](../../../../Sudowrite/464bbb10ed2c49c49d13490fb9c423e4/Public%20Docs/Story%20Bible%20Guide/CleanShot_2026-01-14_at_12.23.42.png)

You can fit an absurd amount of data on each Character card, and Story Bible won’t ever stop you from adding new Characters. You may see the Characters section referred to as unlimited—but that’s not *entirely* true. **If you try to add more than 2,000 different characters to your Story Bible you’ll actually hit the limit!** But if you have more than 2,000 characters… well, have you considered you may actually be writing *a phone book*?

### Importing or Exporting Characters

Sometimes you want to pick up on a work in progress, or just create character cards using the notes you’ve already assembled on your characters.

The smart import feature in Story Bible’s Characters section can be used to instantly create Character cards from an existing text.

![CleanShot 2026-01-14 at 12.26.45.png](../../Resources/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions/Can%20I%20import%20a%20half-finished%20work/CleanShot_2026-01-14_at_12.26.45.png)

To use the smart import feature, navigate to the header of the Characters section of Story Bible and click the Import button in the three dots (•••) menu. Doing so opens the Import window.

![CleanShot 2024-06-17 at 12.20.06@2x.png](../../Resources/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions/Can%20I%20import%20a%20half-finished%20work/CleanShot_2024-06-17_at_12.20.062x.png)

You have the option of importing characters from text or a file. This might be a list of characters, a chapter of your work, or in some cases an entire manuscript.

The raw text pasted in or file uploaded should be no more than 60,000 words. Sudowrite will review that, identify, and import up to 30 characters at a time. Before doing so there is a brief validation step where you can tell Sudowrite not to bother bringing a character in (for example, where it identifies a pseudonym or nickname as a distinct character).

<aside>
ℹ️ The Characters section smart import will accept any of the following file types: 
.txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .odt, .csv

</aside>

Importing characters does not use credits.

### How will Characters be created using the Smart Import?

For "unstructured text" that you paste in or upload by file, Sudowrite will use AI to first identify the characters, and then figure out how best to complete the defined default trait fields.

However, when uploading a CSV, you’re actually not subject to the limits outlined above—you could import more than 30 characters in one shot, if desired. That’s because Sudowrite skips AI if you upload structured data via CSV. It makes the following assumptions:

- Each row represents a character
- Each column represents a character trait
- The first row of the CSV is assumed to be column headers representing field names

If you’d like complete control over the import, you can complete this CSV template manually:

### Exporting Your Characters

While your Story Bible is not included during a typical project export, the Characters section of Story Bible has its own Export feature available, allowing you to download the entirety of the Characters section. That file will include all of your Characters, and all of their traits. Here’s how to use it.

**Characters Export:**

- Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
- You’ll be presented an Export option
- Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns
