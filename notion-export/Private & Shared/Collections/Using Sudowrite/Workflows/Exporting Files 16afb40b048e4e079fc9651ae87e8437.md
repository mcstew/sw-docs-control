Sudowrite offers a few different ways to export your work, allowing you to easily save individual files, projects, or Story Bible sections.

## Project Export

Need to backup your entire project or share all of the documents with a collaborator? The Project Export feature is perfect for these scenarios. It allows you to export all of your documents at once as a bundled .zip file.

**Project Export Purpose:** Export every document in a project at once.

**How to use:**

1. On the Sudowrite home page ([sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com/)) or within the appropriate folder, locate the project card you want to export.
2. Click the More menu (•••) in the upper right corner of the project card.
3. Select "Export (.zip)" from the dropdown menu.

**Project Export Features:**

- Exports all documents within the project
    - Note that the export does not include the Story Bible
- Creates a .zip file for easy storage and sharing

**Use cases:**

- Backing up your entire project
- Sharing your complete work with collaborators or editors

## Export Project as One Document

We added the ability to export your entire project as a single document rather than a .zip file of every document.

Now when you click the **More menu (•••)** on your project, you have the option to export all of that project’s documents *either* as a bundled .zip *or* as one merged document.

If you choose **Export as 1 doc**, the resulting .docx file will include all of your documents in the order that they appear in your project’s left bar (from top to bottom). Documents inside of folders and subfolders are included too, following that sequence. As with the .zip-based export, your Story Bible is not included in the resulting file.

## Document Export

Sometimes you only need to export a specific chapter or single document from your project. The Document Export option allows you to do just that, giving you flexibility in sharing or backing up individual pieces of your work.

**Document Export Purpose:** Export a single document or chapter from your project.

**How to use:**

1. Open the desired project in Sudowrite.
2. Select the document you want to export in the left sidebar.
3. Click the three dot (•••) menu next to the document name.
4. Select "Export (.docx)" from the dropdown menu.

**Features:**

- Exports a single document as a .docx file
- Generally preserves formatting and content of the selected document
- Quick and easy way to share specific portions of your work

**Use cases:**

- Sharing a single chapter with beta readers
- Creating a standalone copy of a document for offline editing

Note that if you’re primarily looking to export a document in order to share it with a collaborator, you may be better served by using Sudowrite’s Document Sharing functionality. Details on Document Sharing, and the collaboration feature we call Clean Copy, are available here: [Collaboration Options](Collaboration%20Options%201a07975fa0ec8074a65dc02f25d4540e.md)

## Story Bible Export

Neither Project Export nor Document Export include your Story Bible contents by default. Some authors choose to copy and paste those fields into a document manually in order to export them, but three sections of the Story Bible each have their own Export functionalities.

**Outline Export:**

- Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Outline section header of your Story Bible
- You’ll be presented an Export option
- Once Exported, you’ll receive a two-column .CSV file with your chapter names in the left column and corresponding chapter summaries in the right column

**Characters Export:**

- Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
- You’ll be presented an Export option
- Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns

**Worldbuilding Export:**

- Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Worldbuilding section header of your Story Bible
- You’ll be presented an Export option
- Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your worldbuilding elements represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns
