### The Basics

**Collection:** Getting Started > Introduction
**Slug:** 8701784-the-basics
**ID:** 8701784
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:03:23.452Z

The world of AI-assisted writing has come a long way over the past few years. If you’re here, you’re probably wondering, how does this thing work and how can I get the most out of it?

Like any creative tool, the person wielding it is ultimately responsible for the quality of results. This is great, because it means the writing you get from Sudowrite will be different from what everyone else gets, and there’s no limit to what you can create.

## 1.) Sudowrite works by reading your text, and then generating text based on what it sees

This has a couple of important implications:

-   **The more specific stuff you put in your document the better** - Sudowrite needs to see enough to understand what story you’re trying to tell in order to give you good results. Try writing, or pasting in, _at least a few paragraphs_ to get it started in the right direction.
    
-   **Junk in, junk out** - Sudowrite assumes that everything you’ve included (in your document, Story Bible, etc.) is _something that you like_. That means that if you _leave_ AI-generated stuff you’re not crazy about in your doc, Sudowrite will keep giving you more suggestions you’re not crazy about. To get better suggestions, make sure the substance and form of what’s in your project is at a level you like.
    
-   **Different features see different things** - If there’s important information you want Write to take into account before generating text, make sure it’s in your document, the Key Details box in Write Settings, or your Story Bible. Or, in Guided mode, _tell_ Sudowrite what to write and it will follow your instructions. Click the drop down arrow directly to the right of the Write button to find these options. Meanwhile, the History card in the right column will displays “chiclets” that highlight what context Sudowrite took into account while doing its thing.
    

## 2.) Sudowrite is kind of random (on purpose)

-   Think of Sudowrite suggestions as pitches from a writing partner. You can take them, leave them, or improve them to get the best result. A “yes, and” mindset is ideal for working with AI (just like with humans)!
    
-   Sometimes Sudowrite will say something that seems super random. That doesn’t mean you did anything wrong, or that there’s a problem with Sudowrite—but it does mean you should try to understand why the AI made that choice. Try a second time, and see if you get better results. If not, or if you find you have to press the button 3-5 times to get a result you like… 👇
    

## 3.) There’s always a way to improve your results

-   Choosing the right feature can help you get better results
    
    -   **Write**
        
        -   _Auto_ is for when you don’t know what should come next and you just want to see what the AI comes up with.
            
        -   _Guided_ is for when you have an idea of what should happen but want Sudowrite to draft it for you.
            
    -   **Describe** gives you suggestions for rich sensory details—sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste—that you can add to any moment or object.
        
    -   **Rewrite** improves phrasing, flow, or tone in an existing passage.
        
    -   **Brainstorm** helps generate lists of ideas: names, powers, plot twists, worldbuilding elements, and more.
        
    -   **First Draft** generates an extended scene (typically 800–1,000+ words) based on an outline or set of notes.
        
    -   **Expand** adds length to your draft—whether that means slowing pacing or fleshing out a moment. _(Tip: Use Describe if what you need is added detail.)_
        
    -   **Plugins** are customizable tools that extend Sudowrite’s core functionality. Use them to tweak tone, change POV, enhance dialogue, or build your own custom tool by describing what you want Sudowrite to do.
        
    -   **Scenes** (found in the Draft tool) are a structured way to outline and generate your chapters. Each scene focuses on a specific time, place, or POV, and supports **Extra Instructions** to guide tone, pacing, and style. (Note: Scenes replaced the older _Beats_ system.)
        
    -   **Draft** is a way to generate an entire chapter of 3,000-5,000+ words at a time, based on the Scenes you’ve established.
        
-   If you’re not getting the kind of results you want after trying a few times - look at the input you gave Sudowrite. Ask yourself **_“Why would Sudowrite think this is OK?”._** You will probably be able to find a reason, or an opportunity to clarify.
    
    -   _Example:_ You are writing a werewolf story and you wrote that the moon is showing, but Sudowrite’s Write feature is not suggesting that the character turn into a werewolf. Isn’t it obvious that should happen? Solution: Inspect the Write card’s chiclets (in the History column) and make sure Sudowrite looked at your Character card… if it did, make sure the detail that the character is a wereworlf is included!
        
-   If the writing you’re getting is not in your voice, look at your document and remove anything that isn’t a match to what you’d like Sudowrite to write for you. Or, use Rewrite to improve it.

Sudowrite is an AI toolkit for novelists that will help you plan, write, edit, and organize your work. It can offer suggestions, enhance prose, facilitate brainstorming and much, much more. You can focus on the parts of the writing process that you love, and get help from the AI with everything else.

When getting started on Sudowrite, you can spin up a Story Bible from your notes, or use the Import tools to bring in a work-in-progress or finished book (in case you’d like to write the sequel). Here’s a video that quickly runs down some of what Sudowrite is capable of.

📓 What does Sudowrite do transcript

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript is available by expanding this toggle.

Sudowrite is the AI writing partner of your dreams, full of tools that help you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page.

Whether you want to start a new project or bring in a half-finished work, you can use Sudowrite for every step of your writing process—from brainstorming and planning to writing, editing, and beyond.

Use the Brainstorm tools to generate and collect fresh ideas, or just pop open chat to discuss your story.

Throw your unstructured ideas into Story Bible’s Braindump section and gradually expand that into a fully developed outline. Fill out these boxes manually, let Sudowrite do it for you, or collaborate with the AI.

With your Story Bible complete, you can generate Scenes, and after making sure they reflect your vision, turn those into full chapters of prose using the Chapter Generator.

If you’re more of a pantser than a plotter, use the Write button to get unstuck with inspired suggestions. And then use Expand to flesh things out, or Describe to add rich sensory details.

Finally, use Rewrite to dial in your voice—or Quick Edit to transform your prose according to specific instructions.

When you’re done, you can even find Plugins that will help you write a query letter—so you can line up an agent to help you sell your masterpiece.

Planning, writing, revising, editing… No matter where you could use support in your writing process, Sudowrite is there for you. Try it today for free at [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com)

### Glossary

**Collection:** Getting Started > Sudowrite Manual
**Slug:** 1326552-glossary
**ID:** 1326552
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:22:43.615Z

When you’re attending Sudowrite classes or reading documentation, there’s a good chance you’ll encounter some jargon along the way. This glossary is intended to clarify any terms that may be ambiguous—whether they’re related to Sudowrite, artificial intelligence, or writing craft.

### List of Helpful Terms

1.  **Scenes:** Sudowrite’s Draft tool uses “Scenes” as building blocks to architect a chapter. In the context of Sudowrite, each Scene represents a discrete moment in your story—typically unified by location, time, and/or point of view. You can generate Scenes based on chapter summaries from your linked Outline, or write them by hand. Scenes support _Extra Instructions_ (such as tone, pacing, or style notes) once you’re ready to generate full chapter prose from them. (Note that Scenes replaced an older _Beats_ system for prose generation.)
    
2.  **Boxes**: Within Sudowrite, “boxes” are generally in reference to text fields—specifically the “boxes” associated with the Story Bible feature (Style box, Genre box, etc.).
    
3.  **Brainstorm:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s Toolbar by default, Brainstorm is a tool for generating fresh ideas for anything from plot points to settings to character names. The user can thumbs down to generate fresh ideas, or thumbs up to add something to a keepers list—which will be saved to their History section once they Save and Exit the tool.
    
4.  **Canvas:** Canvas is a feature that allows users to visually map out their outline or character relationships, using drag and drop elements such as cards and boxes.
    
5.  **Cards**: Cards appear in a couple of places within the Sudowrite interface, and may refer to Project Cards (on the [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com) homepage) or the outputs of AI functions (such as Write) which appear in Cards in the History column.
    
6.  **Chapter Generator (Deprecated):** The Chapter Generator was a precursor to the Draft tool and Scenes. It allowed users to generate prose from _beats_, which have since been phased out. As of March 31, 2025, Beats are no longer supported and pre-existing beats were automatically converted into Scenes.
    
7.  **Chapter Continuity:** A feature of Sudowrite that allows you to tell which document precedes which, in order to help the AI achieve improved narrative consistency, pacing, and character arcs. Some authors have called this “chapter glue” in the past when distilling the critical events of a chapter was a manual process, but Sudowrite now reads back across sequential documents for you.
    
8.  **Credits**: Credits fuel Sudowrite’s AI functions. The different plans available come with different amounts of monthly credits, and those credits are used towards Sudowrite’s AI functions.
    
9.  **Describe:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, Describe will generate sensory descriptions (for Sight, Smell, Taste, Sound, Touch, and Metaphor) for a highlighted selection of text.
    
10.  **Document**: Documents are essentially text files that appear in a list format inside of a Project’s left bar. They’re used to divide your Project up (whether that’s into Chapters or otherwise).
     
11.  **Drivers:** While not a feature or function of Sudowrite in particular, these are elements that move a story forward. They may be major plot points, character decisions, or events that create conflict and propel the narrative towards its resolution.
     
12.  **Extra Instructions:** An optional input field available in each Scene within the Draft tool. It allows you to guide the AI on tone, pacing, POV, or other stylistic choices, helping shape more intentional prose.
     
13.  **Focus:** This is not too far off its base definition, but within Sudowrite it often refers to maintaining clarity and relevance in the scene. It involves ensuring that the action contributes meaningfully to the overall story.
     
14.  **Guardrails**: This typically refers to the boundaries or rules that you set for your scene, helping to keep any AI generations on track. They may include genre conventions, character motivations, and thematic limits. There is no explicit guardrails feature, and instead this is reinforced through clear instructions (whether in the Extra Instructions field, Key Details, or elsewhere).
     
15.  **Hover Menu / Selection Menu:** When selecting a passage of text within the editor, a selection menu will appear for quick access to potentially relevant tools.
     
16.  **Kitbashing**: Originally a term from model building (where parts from different kits are combined), this term generally refers to the process of combining/merging various elements or parts of different drafts (or AI generations) to build a desired work.
     
17.  **Laser Tools**: This colloquialism is used by the community in reference to Sudowrite’s targeted AI features, such as Rewrite, which operate on a targeted selection of text.
     
18.  **LLM**: Large Language Model, a type of AI that can understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It's the technology that (alongside a few others) powers tools like Sudowrite.
     
19.  **Match My Style**: This is a feature inside of Story Bible that analyzes an authors work and produces a Style prompt in order to help the AI more faithfully replicate the user's writing style.
     
20.  **Model**: In AI terminology, a model refers to a trained AI system that can process input data (like text) and generate output based on its training. Examples may include GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and more. Different models work behind the scenes of Sudowrite, but are also available to select explicitly when building Plugins.
     
21.  **Plugins**: In Sudowrite, Plugins are custom community-built features that can be installed and used to extend Sudowrite’s functionality. They may generate, transform, or analyze text—or do any combination of those things!
     
22.  **Prose**: This generally references the written text in your Sudowrite document, but depending on the usage it may be an explicit reference to the “prose” output by Sudowrite’s Draft tool or the Write button.
     
23.  **Project**: In Sudowrite, a Project refer to a discrete writing project—often a single novel or story—that is represented by a Project card on Sudowrite’s homepage. Projects may contain many documents, but each Project only has a single Canvas and Story Bible.
     
24.  **Project Cards**: Visual representations of projects within Sudowrite, providing at-a-glance access to a project’s word count and last edit date, as well as one-click access to the documents within.
     
25.  **Prompt**: A text input given to an AI or software tool to generate specific output or perform an action, often used in creative writing to inspire or guide the AI's output.
     
26.  **Prose Mode:** This is a Sudowrite-specific term for the AI selected for a task (in either the Write settings or the Draft tool). It includes Muse, Excellent, Basic, and experimental AI models (which have not been as extensively tested or optimized) as well.
     
27.  **Quick Edit:** Available within the hover menu upon text selection or via a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + K, ⌘ + K), Quick Edit allows for instruction-based edits. Previously a “Quick Chat” was available as well, but that has been deprecated in favor of a richer, full “Chat” that now lives in the right bar. Together these were previously referred to as “Quick Tools.”
     
28.  **Rewrite:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, the Rewrite button can be used on a selection of text to transform it according to the selected Rewrite style (ranging from Shorter, to Rephrase, to Show Not Tell). It also appears in the selection menu upon selection.
     
29.  **Series / Series Folder:** This is a reference to someone’s sequential works, often novels, that exist within the same universe. Meanwhile, a Series Folder is something that can be created in Sudowrite to share certain Story Bible elements that are typically siloed (like Characters and Worldbuilding) between different projects.
     
30.  **Story Bible**: Sudowrite’s Story Bible is a feature available inside of each Project that lets you document (and/or generate) and store necessary storytelling components for the AI’s reference—to keep your AI-generated assistance on track. It includes Braindump, Genre, Style, Synopsis, Characters, Worldbuilding, and Outline.
     
31.  **Story Engine (Legacy)**: An earlier term used interchangeably with Story Bible. While you may still see “Story Engine” in older videos or guides, most references now point to the combined tools of Brainstorm, Story Bible, and the Draft interface, which together help structure your novel.
     
32.  **Token**: In artificial intelligence, a token is a measurement of text processed and/or generated by AI. A token is on average about 3/4 of a word. You won’t typically see tokens referenced on Sudowrite, but they do exist under the hood—and when people are discussing “context limits” for model (as in Plugin building), that’s what they’re referring to.
     
33.  **Write Button**: One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, the Write button is like an advanced autocomplete that can generate anywhere from a 50-2,000 word completion from wherever you leave the cursor. In the Write Button’s dropdown, you’ll find variants of the Write button including Guided Write (which works similarly but takes or offers suggestions) and Tone Shift (which continues in the selected tone).
     
34.  **Write Settings**: This is an option available in the dropdown next to the Write button, which allows you to define how that button works. You can select creativity, the number of cards, card length, and even the Prose Mode.
     
35.  **My Voice**: My Voice is a Feature that was beta tested on Sudowrite that allowed authors to train custom models that sounded just like their source work. Development on My Voice has been paused.

### Interface

**Collection:** Getting Started > Sudowrite Manual
**Slug:** 2044890-interface
**ID:** 2044890
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:21:11.104Z

# **Sudowrite Main Interface**

Sudowrite’s main writing interface inside of a project is divided into 3 columns.

In the left column you have the Project’s Document organization. The primary writing area, your text editor, comprises the middle section. Finally, to the right is the Chat bar, where you’ll also find a History section that stores results from AI tools as “cards.”

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6859b8261546fe601b93/019be120-f4e4-7999-883a-0dbf2414e258/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9d666b74946797b865f40e48a760467c25f734fef1ccb6fde34b3b26f3864df5)

## Projects, Docs and Folders

On login, you’re dropped into Sudowrite’s homepage. That’s where you’ll find all of your **Projects**. Click into any project to enter the editor (as depicted above), where you’ll find your **Document**(s) listed along the left. You can **Add New** documents or **Import** your existing work here in the left nav—in either case, those individual docs will be listed there. Add New also gives you the option of creating **Folders**, which can be used to organize your Documents.

Meanwhile, each of Sudowrite’s AI functions (highlighted below) outputs results as Cards, which appear in the History bar on the right side of the text editor.

## Cards

Most Sudowrite features will place your responses into a **Card** in the History section on the right side of the screen. (First Draft, and Quick Edit do not.)

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6859b8261546fe601b93/019be122-935a-742c-94f8-47a75865580e/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5bb451aa784522f010d9930e63ad170b086cbdd208db764ef1d8897e2c25a268)

Click anywhere on the white card to collapse the response, and click again to expand it and view the full context of the prompt and response. The top of every card pile will have the _Prompt_ in italics: this is what Sudowrite took into consideration in order to generate the cards. You’ll also get “chiclets” which showcase the context the AI took into consideration while doing its work. The card will be labeled with the name of the feature you used. In the example below, it was Write.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6859b8261546fe601b93/019be123-c0b4-7b25-bab6-02cfe949b256/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d1ff0d12d9a94da5e3525d6307aef833d49b60770c2296b087de6ff0a4ae0333)

The last part of the interface to be aware of is the Toolbar that sits along the top of those three columns. The Toolbar is where you’ll find several of Sudowrite’s core AI features, which you can read more about next.

## Onboarding to Sudowrite

When you first sign up for Sudowrite you’re dropped directly into a product tour that offers a guided walkthrough of some core features. If you breezed through that, or it’s just been a while and you’d like a refresher, you can always take that tour again.

To do so, just click on the question mark icon (❓) up in the top right corner of the interface to access your **Resources**, then select **Quickstart Tour**.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6817df8d39c440bbcaf4/019be11b-48ff-7512-9ccf-ae3edb10f89c/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=46713f1e663cfd17290eb4989d3a6a57035723c353f0afaabbfedf0b4f80c2ff)

The upper right corner of Sudowrite on your homepage. The question mark icon reveals resources, and the gear icon is your Account Settings.

📓 **Sudowrite Simplified transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a full transcript is available by expanding this toggle.

Whether you write novels or non-fiction, Sudowrite is the fastest way to get your ideas out of your head and onto the page… but before you can get started, it helps to know your way around the software.

Today we’ll review Sudowrite’s interface and features, and showcase how you can use it to brainstorm, write, edit, and stay organized.

For starters, I'm going to click this Home button in the upper left so we can start from the Sudowrite homepage. The homepage is where all of your projects appear.

Projects are represented by these little cards, which showcase a project title, a snippet from the first document inside of the project, a word count and an edited date. These three buttons expand a menu that will let you delete a project—and if you have deleted a project, you’ll see a Trash over here. This is also where you’ll find a Plugins button—Plugins are user-created features, which are a bit more advanced, so we’ll cover those in another video but feel free to explore them on your own too.

Down here on the right are some pinned resources and reference materials—for example, this link to our live classes.

In the upper right here, you'll see a gear. This is the Settings for Sudowrite. If I expand it, I'll see my Account Details, but then also some Controls so I can customize my Sudowrite experience—everything from the font and text size to line spacing to the actual color palette that Sudowrite uses here in the Theme.

Now I'm going to click into an existing project here to get started. Let’s begin by taking a quick look at the Sudowrite user interface. There are four main sections of it that you should know about. The primary section right here is the Editor. On its own, this rich text editor should look familiar, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. You’ll see a Find & Replace button and formatting options along the top here.

Off to the right, you see a History section, which is where “cards” with AI-generated text will appear when you use most of Sudowrite’s AI features. The card gives you the chance to review the AI-generated text before inserting it into your document, and you can always refer back to it—or even star it to save it in a short list for later.

In this left bar, you'll see the name of your project up top, and then all of the documents inside of your project down below. Documents are often chapters, but you can actually organize this section however you like. Your Documents will be titled automatically once you've written a sufficient amount inside of the body of the doc, but you can also rename them either by clicking on the three dots or by double-clicking the title. The same goes for your project title—rename it by clicking on it.

You can add a new document by clicking Add New, or you can upload an existing document from your computer.

The fourth section of the interface is the feature toolbar along the top. These are the main AI features of Sudowrite, which you can learn more about by hovering your cursor over… but we’ll dive into them right now.

Let’s start with Brainstorm. If I click on it, I'm prompted with this, which lets me select from any of the different things I could brainstorm. No matter what you select, the Brainstorm tool looks and works the same—it just changes the prepopulated sample text for your reference.

Click the refresh button to change the sample text up—or provide your own Brainstorm prompt.

Once I click Start, I'm sent directly into the Brainstorm flow. I can use the little thumbs up to add something to my keepers list, or the thumbs down if I don’t like something and want to receive a new suggestion. Once I have a Keepers list I'm happy with, I can click Save and Exit, and you'll see the results of that Brainstorm session appear in my history column.

There is another way to brainstorm, and that's by using what we call Chat. You’ll find Chat in the right column next to the History tab where your AI cards appear. You can also get to it by using a keyboard shortcut, which is Control K on a PC or Command K on a Mac then pressing Tab.

Chat is where you can ask a question, say… ask for some interesting settings for your Sci-Fi story. Chat can see what you highlight, along with the context of your Story Bible, and make a suggestion.

With Brainstorming out of the way, let’s look at Writing on Sudowrite. To help illustrate this next point, I’ve added a sample story to this document. When writing it I got stuck… but if I want Sudowrite to help me continue it, I just click the Write button.

The Write button is like a super advanced autocomplete that gives me suggestions on how to proceed. It won't change anything in the body of my document, but instead it will generate cards in the History column. If you want a little more control over how write works, you can click this arrow to the right of the button—here you’ll find Guided Write, which provides or accepts generalized suggestions on how to proceed, and Tone Shift, which works just like Write but in a tone that maps to whatever you select here. You also have full control over Write’s Auto mode here in the settings… in case you wanted to crank up the creativity, change the length of the cards that are produced, or even toggle prose modes. (Prose modes will change the output a bit, since you’re essentially changing the AI that’s doing the work for you.)

Now, if in the course of writing you realize you need to flesh out some details, you can use what we call the Describe button. So if I highlight "ancient items and mystical objects" here, I can use the Describe button to get a more detailed description of those things. Clicking this dropdown to the right of Describe will show you all of the senses that Describe will generate a card for—if you don’t need to smell the high school locker room, make sure you toggle that off before clicking Describe on that phrase. When clicking Describe, you'll see the results in the right column just like other AI outputs. Along the bottom of each card here you’ll see both an Insert and a Copy button, but you can also highlight any section that works for you, copy it, and just paste that into your document.

When it comes to editing your work, you have a few options available. I mentioned Quick Edit earlier—that’s available from the hover menu when you highlight something, but also by the Command K / Control K shortcut. Quick Edit is about as simple as it gets—just tell it what you want to change about your work. You can say “expand on this,” “rephrase this” or “change this to first person.” You’ll get a struck-through version of your original prose, and underlined in green you’ll see the suggested replacement—which you can then accept, reject, or further edit by providing follow-up instructions.

The other main way to edit is with what we call the Rewrite button. Just highlight a section you’d like to rewrite, up to 6000 words, then click Rewrite. A Rewrite selector will appear in the History bar, where you’ll choose how you want the Rewrite to work—shorter, more show, not tell, or even if I want to do something custom. So I can customize this and say, be more quirky or make this really dark and foreboding. For now, let's just use rephrase. When I say go, Rewrite gets to work. And you'll see the rephrase suggestion appears in my right column here. If I like what I see and I click Insert, it replaces the text that I already had highlighted.

Finally, when it comes to staying organized on SudoWrite, there are two main ways for you to do that. The first is Canvas, which is a visual way to stay organized. If you’re someone who likes to visually map things out before you get to work, Canvas lets you do that. You can generate full outlines, move cards around, even visualize and track your character relationships here.

The other way to stay organized is called Story Bible, and it’s one of Sudowrite’s more advanced features. Story Bible is a place for structured notes— it’s where you can put all of the details you know for sure about your story. So you'll see Braindump, Genre, Style, Synopsis, Characters, and Outline. The idea is everything you know for sure can go here, but anything you don't know or want a little help with can be generated with some help from AI.

So once you've added a Braindump and a Genre and a Style, you could generate a Synopsis. If the generation doesn't map to your vision, you can manually change that before proceeding to the next step. You have the option to generate something like a characters list (which would pull in any characters you’ve already mentioned, while generating some new ones)... but you can also bring your own character list entirely

The goal is to fill out your entire Story Bible and gather those essential storytelling components in one place. If you complete your Story Bible, you even have the option to generate chapter-by-chapter prose… you would do that using the Chapter Generator in a document. The best part is, with a full Story Bible, tools like Write get smarter—they’ll refer to your genre, tone, and character list to make sure they’re sticking to the project parameters you’ve defined.

Story Bible is powerful, and quick to learn, but more difficult to master. For a deep dive on it, I’d recommend attending one of our live classes, or even joining our super active Sudowrite community Discord server where we share class recordings.

That’s it for our introduction, but let us know what questions you might have in the comments here. See you in the Discord, and Happy Writing.

### Do credits roll over?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 8376305-do-credits-roll-over
**ID:** 8376305
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:33:15.378Z

Only credits on the **Max** plan will roll over. Otherwise, unused credits expire at the end of each monthly refresh cycle on both the **Hobby & Student** and **Professional** plans.

📅For example, if you signed up for a Professional plan at 2:02pm ET on the 5th of February, unused credits will expire and new credits will be added on the 5th of each month at 2:02pm ET.

If, on the other hand, you signed up on the 31st, on months where there is no 31st day, your billing cycle ends on the last day of the month.

Rollover credits are reserved for **Max** plan subscribers. As long as you maintain an active subscription on the Max plan, your unused credits do not expire monthly and will instead roll over for up to 12 months from date of issue.

There is actually one other exception to credits expiring, and that’s _purchased_ credits on any plan\*.\* If you run out of credits _before_ your monthly refresh, you do have the option of purchasing more. Purchased credits never expire, and will remain on your account indefinitely in case you exhaust your monthly allotment again in the future.

### How many credits do features use?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 6362317-how-many-credits-do-features-use
**ID:** 6362317
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:51:22.509Z

Since credit use is calculated based on a task’s complexity, **different features on Sudowrite use different numbers of credits**. Simple, targeted features like Rewrite or Describe are often very credit-efficient—whereas asking Sudowrite to generate a full chapter of prose from your Scenes is complex, and will consume quite a few credits.

Where it gets complicated is… there’s no way to predict how many credits features will use, and **even the same feature may use different numbers of credits** depending on the Prose Mode or AI model selected (and/or the input context).

Here’s an example using the Write button. I’ve asked Sudowrite to generate 200 words that continue my story, once with Muse, once with Claude 4.1 Opus, and once with GPT-5 Nano.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f696667df40e13a88b842/019be12e-beec-78e0-8133-9c5757b8c9ca/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=463b3c6ca129e0b622b2c361cf08a5b8c8058280beadd8fdbd0bdeb720d49098)

Each time, Sudowrite read the exact same stuff—some context from Story Bible, including Character and Worldbuilding details, as well as a chapter and a half of my existing work. But the credits used varied wildly. I can view my credit use by clicking the gear icon (⚙️) in the upper right and choosing “**Show Recent Activity**.”

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f696667df40e13a88b842/019be12f-1eda-7a10-9d5f-e630833de169/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c5b2c7c9adab1b42e6e260f996a28447faf51ed9591879b3f1ca975696d5ee3f)

In this case, the super efficient GPT 5 Nano model used only about 70 credits, whereas the costly Claude 4.1 Opus model used over 8,000 credits—that’s over a 100x difference to Write the same number of words! Whether it’s “worth it” is ultimately a matter of taste. Do you prefer the voice of one AI model over another?

Prose Modes are intended to simplify things and maximize value, giving you great quality prose for reasonable credit use. Also, while credits do power Sudowrite’s AI features, not _every_ feature of Sudowrite uses up credits. **Our Quick Edit and Chat features are included with your Sudowrite plan, and free to use by default.** (Though an optional High Quality mode, which _will_ use credits, is available in both.) We’ve also been known to introduce free-to-use models and free beta tests on a time-limited basis.

### What are credits?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 3330910-what-are-credits
**ID:** 3330910
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:30:37.916Z

Each Sudowrite plan tier receives a set amount of credits each month, and those credits are then used towards Sudowrite’s AI features.

Think of credits like arcade tokens. You’ll redeem some credits each time you use an AI feature—exactly _how many_ credits depends entirely on what you’re doing, just like some arcade games use a single token while the air hockey table uses a fist full. When it comes to Sudowrite, the number of credits used depends on the complexity of a task (which means the number of words read, words written, and the AI model doing the work).

All this means is **there’s no 1:1 relationship between the words you generate and the number of credits used**. By way of an example, the 1 million credits of the Professional plan might allow you to generate anywhere from 50,000 to 500,000 AI words in a month (depending entirely on how you go about it).

### What if I need more credits?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 9958048-what-if-i-need-more-credits
**ID:** 9958048
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:16:13.915Z

If you’ve exhausted your monthly credit allotment but would like to keep using Sudowrite’s AI features, you can make one-time purchases of extra credits as necessary. You’ll receive a banner with a link in the event you run out of your monthly credits, but you can also find this option at any time inside of your Settings—just click the (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right, and then select Buy More Credits.

> **Note:** In order to purchase additional credits, you must have an active Sudowrite subscription.

Purchased credits do not expire. They remain associated with your account until they are used up—even if you pause or cancel—but do note that you need to have an active account in order to use them.

It’s also worth noting that Sudowrite will always default to using monthly credits first. That means that if you’ve purchased credits and then see your monthly credits refresh hit your account, Sudowrite will automatically start using the credits that will expire at the end of the month. This helps you reserve the non-expiring purchased credits for the future, in the event that you exhaust your monthly credits again.

### How do I pause or cancel?

**ID:** 6438230
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:29:01.468Z

To pause or cancel your account, click on the Settings (⚙️) gear icon in the top right corner of Sudowrite, and select "Manage Membership." From there, you'll find options to either pause or cancel your subscription, manage your billing, or contact us.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6931c3bf18c3d82300a8/019be12c-3711-7b62-aa14-d7b5448c4cb0/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=54d7ff314a99aab4bcc5455dfd9e2881cc4d99b70375631026900e518fcb233a)

## **What’s the difference between “pausing” and “canceling”?**

### Pausing

**Pausing** a Sudowrite subscription is only available to users on monthly plans. This is because a pause takes effect at the end of your billing cycle, and monthly plans renew every month, whereas annual plans only renew once a year.

When you pause your subscription, you can temporarily stop your billing and credit refresh for up to **three months**. However, pausing requires an additional confirmation step that’s easy to miss. After initiating the pause, you’ll be taken to a separate confirmation page. If this step is not completed, the pause won’t go through. We recommend double-checking your status or referring to the help screenshot, which may need an update for clarity.

### Canceling

**Canceling** your subscription is a permanent stop to your billing cycle. This action ends your plan’s credit refresh and future payments, but **your projects and documents remain accessible**. If you're on an annual plan, canceling is the only available option to end your subscription, as pausing is not supported. Keep in mind that you’ll need an active subscription to access any AI features—even if your documents are still viewable and exportable.

In short, pausing is a temporary suspension for monthly users, while canceling fully stops billing and renewals. Both actions preserve your work, but only an active plan enables continued use of Sudowrite’s AI tools.

We recognize that sometimes things come up that require special consideration! If you have questions about pausing or canceling your plan, please drop us a note at: [hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com)

**ID:** 3173600
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:27:45.690Z

We make it easy to pause, cancel or switch plans. If you decide to change plans, your billing will be adjusted accordingly. If moving to a higher-tier plan, you’ll receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of your current plan, and your billing cycle will restart immediately under the new plan.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6903ad16f2bb98ef5dcb/019be12a-73f7-77a7-9f16-d307da75c737/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5ef001c3e8faf960d67a23e46d98c5a5467ab1311679a0b381ca31d6244d4c68)

To change your plan, click on the Settings (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right of Sudowrite. Then just select Manage Membership, and you’ll be presented with the plan options available to you.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:24:44.934Z

Sudowrite offers three subscription tiers—so whether you’re a hobbyist or a working professional, there’s an appropriate option for you. All plans have full access to _all_ of Sudowrite’s features. The difference between them is simply the number of credits included each month, and whether or not those credits expire.

The plans are:

-   **Hobby & Student:** 225,000 credits - Price: $10/mo (paid annually) or $19/mo (paid monthly)
    
-   **Professional:** 1,000,000 credits - Price: $22/mo (paid annually) or $29/mo (paid monthly)
    
-   **Max:** 2,000,000 _rollover_ credits - Price: $44/mo (paid annually) or $59/mo (paid monthly)
    

As outlined above, discounts are available to those who opt to subscribe annually rather than a monthly. We make it very easy to upgrade, downgrade, take a break, try it again, or cancel forever—and if you’re not 100% satisfied, email us anytime in the first week of your plan, and we’ll refund you.

### Which plan should I get?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Sudowrite Plans
**Slug:** 4733320-which-plan-should-i-get
**ID:** 4733320
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T15:25:54.333Z

Which plan you should choose **depends** entirely on your writing habits and goals. While we can’t say which plan is best for you without that, we can share some things you should consider:

First, **credits don't map to words 1:1**—that is, some Sudowrite features generate a lot of words for a few credits, and other features are more credits intensive. For example, using the Write button or Describe (especially with efficient AI models) uses very few credits. Meanwhile, filling up your Story Bible and then asking Sudowrite to generate your full chapter’s prose could consume quite a few credits.

So given that, you should consider:

-   **What are you writing goals?** Do you want to write a short story or a novel? And do you want to write it in one month, or over three months?
    
-   **How much AI support do you expect to use?** Will you be using the AI features sometimes, or do you want the AI to do a lot of heavy lifting—generating chapter prose for you, for example?
    
-   **Will you mostly be using chat?** Sudowrite plans all include access to Quick Edit and Chat, which are story-aware features _included_ with your plan. That is, these features do not use credits by default (though they each have a High Quality mode available, which does use credits).
    

If you think you’ll _mostly_ use Chat in combination with our Quick Edit feature, then a Hobby & Student plan is probably fine—you’ll barely use any credits with those. On the other hand, if your goal is to write a novel in 30 days, you probably want at least a Professional plan since it will allow you to get a lot of AI support from Story Bible.

There’s no single right answer here. Fortunately, we make it _very_ easy to upgrade, downgrade, take a break, try it again, or cancel forever—so you don’t need to sweat it too much.

If you want some help picking, join our community Discord server at: [https://discord.gg/sudowrite](https://discord.gg/sudowrite)

# Brainstorm

Sometimes you have a good idea of what you need—a new setting for your fantasy epic perhaps—but are tapped out on creative names or fresh angles. That’s where Brainstorm comes in. With Brainstorm, you bring the seed of an idea and get rapid-fire inspiration in the form of a list.

To get started, click the Brainstorm button, and choose from:

-   Dialogue
    
-   Characters
    
-   World building
    
-   Plot points
    
-   Names
    
-   Places
    
-   Objects
    
-   Descriptions
    
-   Article ideas
    
-   Tweets
    
-   Something else
    

Then enter your seed. Maybe it’s “Names and descriptions of spaceships”

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a8875ca99492c59ba6a/019be152-d3b8-7340-98e7-7558ca88b3e8/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8843153fe9366f4ec66edc59876f315a4bc0affc57e9a872eeca35ef4cac96f6)

Click Start and you’ll have a fresh list of spaceship concepts generated for you. You can use the Thumbs Up (👍) to save the ones you like to your Keepers List, and the Thumbs Down (👎) to clear that suggestion from your list (to make space for a new one). When you’re satisfied with your choices, click Save & Exit, and your Keepers List will be saved to a card in your History panel on the right.

Note that Brainstorm works independently, exclusively using the context and examples you provide in the Brainstorm panel. That means it doesn’t see your Story Bible details.

📓 **Brainstorm transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Brainstorm video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome to the next installment in our Quick Start series. Today, we're exploring the Brainstorm button—a tool designed to get you unstuck and fuel your creativity.

Sometimes, you're on the brink of a great idea but need a spark to ignite it. Whether you're dreaming up a new setting for your fantasy saga or searching for the perfect name for your protagonist, Brainstorm can be your creative partner in that process.

Getting started is simple:

Click on the Brainstorm button to unveil a variety of brainstorming categories, including Dialogue, Characters, World Building, Names, and more. Select the category that fits your current need.

Next, input your seed idea. For instance, if you're looking for "Names and descriptions of spaceships," to fill the infinite void of space in your Sci-Fi novel, just type that in.

Hit Start, and like magic, you're presented with a list of inspired suggestions. Found something you love? Give it a Thumbs Up to add it to your Keepers List. Not quite right? A Thumbs Down clears the way for new ideas.

Once you've curated a collection of ideas that spark joy, click Save & Exit. Your Keepers List is then neatly stored in a card within your document’s History panel, ready for you to revisit and incorporate into your masterpiece.

Here’s a little secret about brainstorm—no matter which category you select, the tool functions identically. You’re essentially choosing from pre-populated suggestions and reference material that will help the AI generations along. You can use this little refresh button for fresh suggestions, and you can always use Something Else to start entirely from scratch.

In closing, the Brainstorm button isn’t just a feature… it’s a creative partner standing by to jumpstart your imagination.

There is actually one other way you may go about brainstorming on Sudowrite… but we’ll cover that next time, when we look at the editor’s Selection Menu and Quick Tools.Brainstorm

If you’re the type of author that works visually—say using index cards to map out an outline—you may want to use Sudowrite’s Canvas feature. Think of Canvas as a flexible digital whiteboard where you can drop notes, draft outlines, and freely rearrange everything in a 2D space.

To access Canvas, find the **Canvas** option in the **More Tools** dropdown at the right of the top toolbar. Doing so will bring you into a fresh Canvas, where you’ll see the orientation information represented in the screenshot below. You can click and drag to select these cards in order to delete them all at once, or select something and delete it individually.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6abf75ca99492c5a3dbe/019be157-d870-7104-8e93-b909e208b141/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d721910498ac57a6bc7dfb00b4f0c7cd64e0eb0a89ea2c84f1cbcf1f72355825)

The menu at the bottom of Canvas allows you to add a card, add text, or add an outline.

**Adding a card** gives you a blank card, where you can type anything you’d like to keep track of: some character information, some notes on a scene, or freeform ideas you don’t want to forget.

**Adding text** lets you throw text directly onto the Canvas, which is helpful when you want to label a cluster of cards or otherwise leave annotations for yourself.

**Adding an outline** will place a complete outline directly onto your canvas—represented as a series of linked cards. The outline types available in canvas are The Hero’s Journey, Hollywood Beats, Story Circle, and Romance Outline. Each outline is represented with distinct visuals.

📌Canvas outlines are a bit different from those in Story Bible. In Canvas you can generate a full outline from your idea, whether it’s a single sentence or several paragraphs. You can also use the three dot (•••) menu to copy that outline to your clipboard if you want to bring it back into a Sudowrite document or even import it into your Story Bible.

**Canvas keyboard shortcuts** include:

`⌘ A` – Select all

`Del` – Deletes a card

`Space + Click + Drag` – Pan the canvas

`⌘ Z` – Undo

`⌘ + SHIFT + Z` – Redo

`⌘ +` – Zoom in

`⌘ -` – Zoom out

`*⌘* \\` – Reset to center

`⌘ 0` – Reset zoom

### Chat

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 6204120-chat
**ID:** 6204120
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:24:40.128Z

There’s a new chat in town, and it lives in your project’s right bar. To use it, simply toggle your right bar from History (which is where all your “cards” are generated and stored) to Chat.

You never have to brief Chat, or bring it up to speed, because it can see your entire Story Bible and documents. You can ask it basically anything about your characters or story—or highlight a particular section of text if you want it to focus on that.

It’s also a _chat_, which means you can use it for feedback, brainstorming, edits, and other questions—sort of like ChatGPT, only better because it’s unfiltered and it’s built right into Sudowrite. Did we mention Chat is free to Sudowrite subscribers by default?

### How does chat work?

Chat is **story aware**, which means it can see your existing work in order to be as helpful as possible.

Specifically, when your Story Bible is turned on and filled in, **Chat can see your Genre, Synopsis, Characters, Worldbuilding, and Outline**. It also sees **the full text of the current document**, and it will focus on anything that you’ve **highlighted** in that document (while still seeing the full doc).

Want to direct Chat’s attention to something or someone in particular? **Chat supports @ mentions** that can provide additional context. You can tag a specific Character or Worldbuilding element by using the @ tag. You can even use the @ tag to reference another document in the same project—for example, if you wanted Chat’s help comparing different versions of a chapter, or creating an interstitial chapter.

### Are there limits?

You can have as many chats as you’d like, and you'll find prior conversations when clicking the little folder icon in the upper right. You can create a new chat thread by clicking the plus (**+**) sign. If you’ve been working in one Chat for a _long_ time, you may eventually hit a limit where the oldest chats in your thread become invisible to that Chat (because its context is full). Creating a new Chat will give you a fresh start.

Note that chats are project-specific, which means A.) Chat can’t see documents in a different project, and B.) You can’t access chats that you’ve had in another project.

While Chat is free by default, you also have the option of enabling the High Quality mode. Chat’s High Quality mode uses a smarter AI model, capable of more logically demanding tasks, and it does use credits. Toggle off High Quality to return to the Standard free Chat.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:09:06.564Z

# Describe

Feeling stuck on the details? Describe is a way to very quickly get inspired with some super detailed sensory descriptions of… whatever it is you highlighted. Describe will provide responses broken out by the five senses (Sight, Sound, Touch, Taste, and Smell), as well as a couple of metaphors. Like other features, you’ll find the results in the History column on the right.

To use it, highlight a specific word or phrase and click Describe. It often works best when highlighting a short-to-medium length phrase within a paragraph. It can also work at the paragraph level, if you’d like descriptions for a broader set of objects in your scene. Writing a Young Adult novel set in a High School? You might not be thinking about how the smells from the locker room intrude on your hallway scenes, but Describe will.

And hey, maybe after that you don’t ever want to know what something smells like! In that case, click the dropdown 🔽 toggle to the right of the Describe button to disable or enable sensory descriptions you’d like Describe to respond with when you use it. Turn as many on or off as you like. (You always need at least one sense enabled though!)

_Note: Describe looks at the paragraph where the highlighted phrase resides, as well as up to 200 words prior to the selection for context._

📓 **Describe transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Describe video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome back to our Quick Start series. Today we're exploring the Describe button, a tool that can add depth and detail to your writing with ease.

Sometimes as writers we know the impression we’re trying to create, but we have a difficult time finding the exact words for it. The Describe button provides instant suggestions for sensory descriptions and metaphors for anything we’ve highlighted.

To see what I mean, just click the dropdown arrow to the right of the Describe button. When you do, you’re presented with a list of toggles—one for each of the senses that Describe can output. You can certainly leave them all toggled on, but you can also toggle off the options you know you won’t use. Say your young adult novel has a scene in a locker room—you could go ahead and toggle off smell, for example. Doing so will prevent the AI from generating that sensory detail until you toggle it back on—and it will save you a few credits in the process.

Once you’ve identified a section of your text you’d like enhance with some sensory detail, highlight it and press the Describe button—either from the Selection Menu or the Toolbar. A card will be created in the History column on the right for each of the enabled senses. So you can see here that we have sight, touch, taste, and so on.

Now since Describe works a bit differently than either Write or Rewrite, you probably won’t use the card’s Insert button to insert the entire text of a card. Instead, you can simply highlight what works for you, and then Copy and Paste whatever you like into the body of your document.

As with all cards, you can also Star any of these descriptions to refer back to later.

One final note on Describe. Like the other tools we’ve mentioned, Describe only works on selections made within your document’s editor. That means—as of right now—you’re not able to use the Describe button on something in your Story Bible fields. Not directly, anyway, since you could simply copy paste the thing you’re trying to get descriptions of into your editor before clicking Describe. Just be aware that if you get this error, that’s why.

That about covers it for Describe. Let us know what questions you have in the comments, and join us next time when we look at Brainstorm.

### Expand

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 3974925-expand
**ID:** 3974925
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:15:15.846Z

When you have a scene you know would benefit from some added detail, you can use the **Expand** tool. Expand takes the passage you’ve highlighted and draws that out, adding substance and color as organically as possible. Practically speaking, it can turn one sentence into several.

For example, if you were to highlight “Michael got out of bed and made himself breakfast” and use Expand, you might get back a card in the History column that says, “Michael swung his legs over the side of the bed, and stepped onto the cozy wool rug. He walked to the kitchen, where he moved through his morning routine like a robot, reaching for the market sourdough loaf and loading two thick slices into the toaster. He opened the fridge. His eyes scanned the shelves, and locked in on the blueberry jam. Behind him, the toaster popped prematurely, ejecting the underdone bread to the counter.”

To use it, highlight a sentence or paragraph and choose Expand from the Selection Menu that appears. **Expand requires at least 3 three words be selected, and can be used on up to 1,000 words at a time.**

### What Does Expand See?

Expand is focused on your highlighted selection, but it will read prose in your document that both precedes and follows that selection.

Expand also gets context from your Story Bible, to make sure that it remains faithful to your vision for the story. That context includes, Genre, Style, Characters, Worldbuilding, the linked chapter summary from your Outline, and any POV/Tense that you may have set.

### First Draft

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 0327513-first-draft
**ID:** 0327513
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:13:26.648Z

First Draft is a feature that helps you get the ball rolling when you don’t know where to begin. Whether you’re working on a novel, blog post, article, or essay, First Draft will generate up to **3000 words** based on a prompt you provide—giving you a solid jumping-off point to work from.

It’s intended for that early, idea-spark moment, before you’ve written anything in the document. First Draft offers a substantial foundation you can then edit, refine, or build on.

## How to use First Draft

**First Draft only appears when your document is completely empty.** Here’s how to find it:

1.  **Open a blank document** inside any Sudowrite project.
    
2.  Click on the **Plugins** dropdown in the toolbar.
    
3.  Select **First Draft** from the list.
    

You’ll see a field appear with some example prompts to inspire you below. Just complete that field and click Go!

> **ICYMI:** First Draft only appears in totally blank documents. You won’t find it in the Plugins menu if you’re working in a document you’ve already written in.

### For best results from First Draft

The more detail you provide, the better the draft will be. Here are a few tips:

-   **Fiction?** Include character names, settings, and key events.
    
-   **Non-fiction?** Share the structure or argument you want to make.
    
-   **Something else?** Mention tone, style, or any specific quirks you’d like to see.
    

We recommend giving as much detail as you can here. A sentence or two is fine, but a full paragraph is better. As you type, First Draft gives you feedback on how to improve your prompt—think of it as a writing coach guiding you toward a stronger start.

## What you can expect from First Draft

Once you submit your prompt, Sudowrite will stream a first draft directly into the editor. The draft is:

-   Tailored to the type of content you asked for (fiction or non-fiction)
    
-   Inserted as regular text, ready for immediate editing
    
-   Generated with beautiful sparkles—so you can follow along as it appears!
    

Whether it’s a moody short story opening or a structured blog article, First Draft gives you something real to react to.

## When you should use it

First Draft is perfect if you:

-   Don’t know how to start your story or essay
    
-   Want a quick spark of inspiration
    
-   Prefer editing and shaping over generating from scratch
    
-   Need to experiment with tone, structure, or POV without starting from zero
    

Some common use cases include:

-   Fiction scenes and character intros
    
-   Personal essays or blog entries
    
-   Opinion pieces or structured arguments
    
-   Genre-specific prompts like thrillers, romance, or historical fiction

### My Voice (Beta)

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 1042041-my-voice-beta
**ID:** 1042041
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

Ever wish it was easier to make prose sound more like _you_?

**My Voice lets you train a private, custom model on your work so that Sudowrite can instantly rewrite anything in your voice.** It works like magic, whether what you’re transforming was originally written by the AI or a human writing partner.

✌️ There are two simple steps to using My Voice.

1.  Train a custom My Voice on some existing work.
    
2.  Use that My Voice model to restyle prose.
    

## What you’ll need to create a My Voice model

-   **Existing work:** Have a **sample of your own, human-written text** ready to go. It should be representative of the style you’re looking to replicate.
    
-   **Sample criteria:** Minimum of **1,000 words** with no upper limit. The sample _quality_ is the most important consideration.
    
-   **File types:** Upload a `.txt` file **or** just copy/paste text directly into the modal.
    

⚠️ **Important note**

Avoid using AI-generated text as your training data; it can reduce the quality of the resulting model.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b8fb7a5382a87e11257/0198f1a0-def8-7b08-a8a4-d32d6a2d96f6/b64u-MDE5OGYxYTAtZGU0Yi03ZDgxLTkzYTQtMzU2NGIxMmFmNTcx.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=235aa540c648126fa6aaba308f01d56061f42c97e8e8696e04d12ec3f3bce2e6)

## How to train your My Voice model

1.  Head to Sudowrite and **open any document.**
    
2.  In the bottom of the left sidebar, click **My Voice**—or [just click right here](https://editor.sudowrite.com/app/my-voice).
    
3.  Click **Train New My Voice**.
    
4.  Choose one:
    
    -   **Upload** a `.txt` file, or
        
    -   **Paste** your sample into the text box.
        
5.  Click **Start training**. Training typically takes less than **2 minutes**.
    
6.  When training finishes, you’re returned to the My Voice model list, where your new voice appears.
    
    -   By default, it’s named after your file (or the first part of pasted text).
        
    
    -   To rename it, open the **More (⋯) menu** next to the model and choose **Rename**. This is also where you’ll delete a voice.
        

## Use your voice to revise text

Think of My Voice primarily as an **editing** tool that helps you take a first draft to second, third, and beyond.

1.  **Open your project** and highlight the text you want to transform.
    
    -   You can select **short snippets** or **large sections** (up to **4,000 words**).
        
2.  Select **My Voice** in the Selection Menu that appears to rewrite the highlighted prose in the selected style.
    
    1.  Alternatively, click the down arrow (⌄) next to **My Voice** and choose your preferred model (e.g., _Regency style_). Your most-recently selected model will persist.
        
3.  A card will appear in the History section on the right with your rewritten prose.
    
    ![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b8fb7a5382a87e11257/0198f1a1-22a8-71c1-9f02-10b94c76b694/b64u-MDE5OGYxYTEtMjBjOS03YzliLTg2ZGItYmZlYWE4ZDdlOTM1.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7feea49f2e10c1e04d48d2ce56ce50e752596318115e8dd135935495aaa3fc82)

## Controlling the My Voice intensity

You may find that the first time you use My Voice to rewrite a passage, the style is either too subtle or too pronounced for your liking. Fortunately, you can easily change the intensity of a My Voice rewrite. To do so, simply tweak the **Creativity** slider in your **Write Settings**. (You can find the Write Settings beneath the down arrow next to the Write button in the top toolbar.)

-   **Lower Creativity** → lighter edits, less apparent style, closer to the source.
    
-   **Higher Creativity** → stronger more pronounced rewrites with more stylistic change.
    

**Recommended workflow:** Start near the middle, then adjust up or down based on your preference.

☝️ **Tips & best practices**

-   **Match POV & tense:** Train with samples in the **same point of view and tense** as your target work for most predictable results.
    

-   **Selection length ↔ style strength:**
    
    -   On **short selections**, **high** Creativity may cause the model to **expand** more than you want. If it overwrites or “keeps going,” **lower** your Creativity.
        
    
    -   On **long selections** (approaching 4,000 words), you may need to **raise** Creativity to see sufficient stylistic impact.
        

-   **Iterate to intensify style:** For extra impact, copy the rewritten prose from your My Voice card in the History section, paste it back into your draft, and **run My Voice on it again** for a second pass.
    

## What else to know

-   My Voices are stored privately in your Sudowrite account, accessible only to you. **They are not project-specific**, however, which means you can use any My Voice you train in any of your projects.
    

## Troubleshooting

-   **“It didn’t change much.”**
    
    -   Increase **Creativity** or select a longer passage. Ensure your training sample is strong and representative.
        
-   **“It changed too much / kept writing past my selection.”**
    
    -   Lower **Creativity** and select a slightly longer span for more context.
        
-   **“Results feel off.”**
    
    -   Check that your training sample matches your project’s **POV and tense**, and avoid AI-generated training text.

### Prose Modes & Models

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 2549305-prose-modes-and-models
**ID:** 2549305
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:34:58.952Z

Sudowrite allows you to select from a wide range of Prose Modes and AI models. Choosing different models effectively changes the AI performing the work, impacting output style, creativity, precision, and credit usage.

### What are Prose Modes?

Prose Modes are carefully curated model suites designed specifically for fiction writing, each featuring a base AI model that has been optimized for use in Sudowrite. You can use Sudowrite without ever changing your Prose Mode, but experimenting with different modes allows you to discover variations in output voice.

Prose Modes can be selected in both your Write button Settings and the Draft tool. (Other Sudowrite features currently do not support switching Prose Modes.)

Selecting a different Prose Mode directly impacts the AI models used, influencing credit usage and the style and content of generated text.

### Current Prose Modes

-   **Muse** - The latest version of Sudowrite's flagship fiction model, Muse 1.5, is purpose-built for creative storytelling
    
-   **Excellent** - Powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, balancing creativity with precise instruction-following
    
-   **Basic** - Utilizing GPT-4o Mini, offering economical and efficient drafting
    

Retired, but still usable Prose Modes:

-   **Fastest** - Based on GPT-3.5 Turbo
    
-   **Unfiltered** - Based on Goliath 120B
    
-   **Most Accurate** - Based on GPT-4
    
-   **Muse 1** - A snapshot of the very first version of Muse
    

### What are the Experimental models?

In addition to Prose Modes, Sudowrite offers a variety of specific AI models accessible via Write settings and the Draft tool. These Experimental models have not been extensively optimized for specific writing styles or tasks but you may find that you like their voice, or they may have other benefits (such as speed or cost).

Experimental models currently include:

-   **OpenAI**
    
    -   GPT-4o
        
    -   GPT-4o Mini
        
    -   GPT-4.1 (Full, Mini, Nano)
        
    -   GPT-5 (Full, Mini, Nano)
        
-   **Anthropic (Claude)**
    
    -   Claude 3.0 Haiku
        
    -   Claude 3.5 Haiku
        
    -   Claude 3.7 Sonnet
        
    -   Claude 4 Sonnet
        
    -   Claude 4.5 Sonnet
        
    -   Claude 4 Opus
        
    -   Claude 4.1 Opus
        
    -   Claude 4.5 Opus
        
    -   Claude 4.5 Haiku
        
-   **Google (Gemini)**
    
    -   Gemini Pro 2.5
        
    -   Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking
        
    -   Gemini 3 Pro
        
    -   Gemini 3 Flash
        
-   **DeepSeek**
    
    -   DeepSeek V3
        
    -   DeepSeek V3.1
        
    -   DeepSeek R1
        
-   **Other**
    
    -   Grok 4
        
    -   Kimi K2
        
    -   Mistral Large 2
        

Each AI model offers unique strengths, voices, and capabilities. We encourage authors to experiment broadly to identify the AI that best aligns with their individual writing needs and creative goals.

### So are the Experimental models “raw” models?

Sort of! Keep in mind that Sudowrite has background prompting powering its features, and background functions running (such as Saliency Engine) may influence what is ultimately received/seen by those models. Think of it like this:

Prose Modes = Optimized

Experimental Models = Raw\*

Plugins = Raw

The only ways to use a truly “raw” AI model on Sudowrite is to build a Plugin using that AI model. Elsewhere on Sudowrite we are doing some (or a lot!) of work to make sure things work great.

### Quick Edit

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features

**ID:** 7484270
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:20:14.252Z

### Quick Edit

**Quick Edit** is the fastest way to make light edits to your document, and it’s one of the only tools that works right inside of your document (rather than creating a card in the History section).

Find Quick Edit in the Selection Menu (which appears when highlighting text), or open it with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + K` (PC) or `⌘ + K` (Mac).

Quick Edit is included with your Sudowrite plan, and **free to use** by default. You do have the option of toggling on a High Quality mode that _will_ use credits. While High Quality mode is capable of more complex tasks, we’ve found it’s also rarely _necessary_.

### How Quick Edit Works

When you already know that _something_ needs to change, and you just need a little help _doing it_, Quick Edit takes your instructions and makes those changes for you. Just highlight a sentence, paragraph, or entire scene—up to 1,000 words—and tell Quick Edit what you’d like changed or rewritten.

Quick Edit takes your instruction and goes to work, leaving a struck-through version of your original copy in place for easy comparison. Accept the changes, reject them, or further refine it—all inline.

### What does Quick Edit know about my story?

One of the biggest benefits of Quick Edit is that **it is story aware**. That means it can see your existing work and the contents of Story Bible in order to stay on track.

Quick Edit will focus on the highlighted text you’d like transformed, but it will also take into account your Genre, Style, Synopsis, Worldbuilding elements, and other context-dependent things like matching Characters or a linked chapter summary from your Outline.

# Rewrite

Sometimes you dig the idea you’ve got down, but it’d be helpful to see a few alternative ways to phrase it. Other times, you know you need to be more succinct, more upbeat, or more descriptive. Rewrite can help with all of these!

To use Rewrite: Highlight some text—up to 6,000 words at once—and click “Rewrite”! A Rewrite card with a drop-down menu will appear in the History column (on the right), and you’ll be able to select your desired rewrite style from these pre-set options:

-   **Rephrase:** Rewrite the passage in a different way while retaining the meaning.
    
-   **Shorter:** Rewrite the passage to be more succinct.
    
-   **More descriptive:** Adds more telling details to the passage. Similar to the Describe tool, but the AI will make its own decision on which elements to flesh out and incorporate.
    
-   **Show, Not Tell:** Improves the level of detail and adds in more action.
    
-   **More Inner Conflict:** Add more internal conflict and introspection. Works best when the passage selected is a close POV.
    
-   **More Intense:** Allows the AI to amp things up, improving the level of detail and pacing to create a more vivid reading experience.
    
-   **Customize…:** If you select Customize, you can prompt the Rewrite command with any sort of rewrite approach you’d like. It’s a super open-ended tools, and there are practically unlimited ways to use it. Here are some that our users have found helpful:
    
    -   "be more ominous"
        
    -   “be more like Stephen King wrote it”
        
    -   "be set in a cyberpunk future"
        
    -   “add more dialogue”
        
    -   "contain a metaphor"
        
    -   "make \[name of your main character\] die"
        
    -   "be in first person"
        
    -   "be in third person"
        
    -   "be in third person with name James"
        

While Rewrite works exclusively on the passage you’ve selected, the AI will actually look at your Story Bible’s Synopsis when rewriting shorter (600 words or fewer) passages. This gives it broader context so that its constrained Rewrite is still faithful to the story you’re trying to tell. Longer Rewrites do not use Synopsis.

📓 **Rewrite transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Rewrite video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome to the next video in our Quick Start series. Today, we're diving into the Rewrite button—a powerful feature designed to refine and enhance your existing text.

When you're happy with the substance of something you’ve written, but get the feeling the prose could use another pass—whether for clarity, style, or just a fresh take—Rewrite can do that for you with the click of a button.

Here's how it works: First, select the text you want to revise, up to 6000 words for Rewrite. Then select the Rewrite button—either from the Selection Menu or the toolbar. You'll see a selector appear in the History column on the right. This is where you’ll choose how you want Rewrite to modify your work—rephrased, shorter, more show/not tell, or even something custom. So you could say “be more quirky” here, or “make this really dark and foreboding.” For now, we’ll use Rephrase.

When I say Go, Rewrite gets to work, and we see new cards appear in that History column. Once your results are ready, you’ll see the updated prose here—and you’ll notice that anything Sudowrite’s AI changed is presented in purple. If you like what you see, just click insert, and it will replace your highlighted selection

You have one additional control with Rewrite, and that’s how many cards it will generate at once. Just click the drop down arrow to the right of the Rewrite button to set your preference—then each concurrent use of Rewrite will output that many card options in the future.

Something to be aware of is that, as of right now, the Rewrite button does not take Story Bible or other story context into account when you use it. Rewrite is focused exclusively on your selection and preferred Rewrite style.

That covers it for Rewrite. Drop your questions in the comments, and stay tuned for the next video in our Quick Start Series focused on the Describe button.

### Selection Menu

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 8443420-selection-menu
**ID:** 8443420
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:23:59.319Z

# Selection Menu

One of the most powerful tools on Sudowrite is hidden until you highlight something—and it’s called the Selection Menu.

This smart menu will appear, hovering over your document, once you’ve selected text. It will change based on what exactly you’ve highlighted. For example, highlight a _single_ word and you’ll have the option to use Comment, Describe, open Quick Edit, or select from Related Words. Meanwhile, choose a longer selection of text and you’ll get options such as Comment, Rewrite, Expand, or Visualize as well.

In some cases the Selection Menu is a quicker and easier way to access the toolbar tools—like Rewrite or Describe. But in other cases, the Selection Menu is the primary (or exclusive) way to access a feature. The features that are primarily accessed via the Selection Menu are:

**Related Words** - This feature is a smart thesaurus. A handful of related words will appear in the Selection Menu when you’ve selected a single word, but you also have the option to expand and view a full Related Words word cloud.

**Comment** - Annotate your work, leaving a comment on a highlighted passage.

**Expand** - Take a selection of text and make it longer and more detailed.

**Visualize** - Visualize can be used to generate an image from a passage of text.

**Quick Edit** - Quick Edit allows you to make fast, custom inline edits in your document. Quick Edit is available by a keyboard shortcut, but it will also always appear as an option in the Selection Menu—whether you’re selecting a single word or an extended passage.

📓 **Selection Menu partial transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a partial transcript specific to the Selection Menu is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome back to our Quick Start series. Today, we'll be diving in on Sudowrite’s Selection Menu and Quick Tools.

Did you know there are a few secret features on Sudowrite? They’re not really secret, but they are sort of hidden in plain sight. They live in what we call the Selection Menu. The Selection Menu appears when you’ve highlighted a selection of text.

It’s actually a pretty smart menu—it will only ever be populated with options that are appropriate for the text that you’ve highlighted. Here’s what I mean: Highlight a single word, and you’ll see a few alternatives that you might find in a Thesaurus. Click on 15 More, and you’ll open a panel that we call Related Words, with even more suggestions available. You can select another word—either directly from the Selection Menu or from Related Words here—for a quick inline replacement.

With a single word selected, you also have the option to either Describe or Quick Edit. We’ve already reviewed the Describe function, and I’m sure you can imagine how getting some sensory details might be applicable to a single word. We’ll look at Quick Edit in just a moment—

But first… notice how when you highlight a full paragraph, the Selection Menu changes. Joining Describe and Quick Edit are Rewrite—which we’ve already covered—Expand, and Visualize.

Clicking Visualize will generate an image inspired by your selected prose. Just like all of Sudowrite’s other AI features, the results of Visualize will show up in a card in the History column on the right.

q

Meanwhile, Expand will take a selection of text and make it longer while adding some new details. As you can see with my selection here, I had a very brief paragraph where someone left the orchard for home, and after Expanding this it has slowed the action into a more methodical and detailed journey.

### Series Support

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 1251175-series-support
**ID:** 1251175
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:42:02.441Z

Whether you currently write a book series or you aspire to, you can take advantage of **Series** support in Sudowrite to share important information between projects. Projects created in or moved into a **Series Folder** will share Characters, Worldbuilding, and Outline visibility so that your books’ shared universe, character arcs, and plot lines remain consistent.

### Create a Series

Create a new Series in Sudowrite by clicking the **\+ New** button in the upper lefthand corner of the homepage and selecting **Series** from the dropdown menu. This will create a project folder with a special Series icon and label. Name it as you would with any other folder.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16a-d2f6-7fd9-910d-fc60ede921e5/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=02cd0aec4cc13e700dd8506c95ec0ffe89e783311ddc231fe3ad8fd51073261b)

Series folders can be created either on the main homepage or within another folder.

☝Series will only share Story Bible data between projects in the same hierarchy—meaning if you create a sub-folder inside of a Series folder with additional projects, the data from those projects will not be visible to the projects one level up in the primary Series folder.

## How Series Works

### Characters and Worldbuilding

**Projects within a Series share Characters and Worldbuilding elements.** That means that if I create characters Jane, John, and Jerry in Book 1, I’ll still be able to see and edit those characters in Book 2 just so long as both Projects (Book 1 and Book 2) are in the same Series folder.

Further, changes made to Characters and Worldbuilding elements will be reflected across all books in that Series Folder. This is not just for your reference either; Sudowrite’s AI also has access to all of your Characters and Worldbuilding elements in a Series. Plus, it will remember (and show you!) which book your characters were originally created in.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16c-254a-7ee3-a4f5-6173f8cded53/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ce7a491a8f9e039d27ee6ac2f483a242932ce8ea6cefd51beaef367eab05e09f)

### **Best Practices**

Because Sudowrite’s AI has access to all of your Characters and Worldbuilding elements in a Series, it’s a good idea to keep them up to date for whichever volume you’re currently working on. For example, if I have a character Liam who is the protagonist of Book 1, but more of a supporting character in Book 2, I can change his type to reflect whichever Book I am working on.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16c-8102-7729-bf08-41af988ae508/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6db88b185688e98a6e3203dc0091d167e5ea975b98067dae8ae99d707d5a5c9f)

If you have characters that only appear in one book, and you don’t want them showing up in others, it may be a good idea to “hide” them from the AI when working on a volume in which they do not play a part. Toggle the eyeball icon that appears when hovering over a Character or Worldbuilding card, and that card is hidden from Sudowrite entirely. (You can always change it back.)

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16d-340b-79df-a796-0349bafce978/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=743a6d6381a08bcc156b064395ed6cdb686bcdaeeef00022e10b6de6f5fafd5d)

For more complex character arcs or development of Worldbuilding elements, it may be beneficial to create multiple versions of a card—one for each book, or at least for dramatic milestones—and simply hide/show the most relevant version as your work progresses across a series. Alternatively, you can have a single canonical Character card or Worldbuilding element that is shared and used across the series, updating it as you go, or using the visibility settings on individual traits.

### Outlines

Projects in a Series automatically use Sudowrite’s Outline Unlimited. The structured nature of Outline Unlimited allows other projects to have quick access to any outline in the Series folder.

To access Outlines from different projects, use the dropdown menu in the Outline header section of Story Bible to select the outline you wish to view.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16d-8ed7-7279-91c5-c161537ac274/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d756ea0c7e20d674f30659469e9721e619c283de69620c4212ef5aa4009aa4dc)

When viewing an Outline from a different project than the currently open project, **you can both make edits and generations with that Outline**. These changes will persist and be reflected in that project’s Outline moving forward.

Note that when viewing an Outline from a different project, you will not be able to link documents in the current project to chapters in that Outline. You may currently only link chapter summaries in the open project’s outline to documents in that project.

## Adding a Project to a Series

Once you have created your Series Folder, there are a couple of ways to add a project to that series.

-   Drag and drop an existing project on the homepage into the Series Folder
    
-   Use the **More (•••) menu** and select **Move to…** to select the Series Folder from a list of available folders, and move it over
    
-   Creating a new Project using the **\+ New** button when you’re inside of a Series Folder will create a blank project that instantly has access to shared Series information
    
-   Importing a project with the **Import Novel** button from within a Series Folder automatically adds that project to the series, and any Characters or Worldbuilding elements that are detected as part of the import process will be shared across the series.
    

When you add an existing project to a Series Folder:

-   All of that projects Characters and Worldbuilding elements are automatically shared with the rest of the projects in that Series Folder.
    
-   Any duplicates are preserved, and added to the shared Characters and Worldbuilding. This allows authors to create different “versions” of Characters/Worldbuilding elements across volumes in their Series.
    
    -   If you do not wish to have different versions, we recommend reviewing your shared Characters and Worldbuilding after adding an existing project and deleting (or hiding from the AI) any duplicates that are superfluous.
        
-   If the project moved into a Series Folder is using Story Bible’s old Outline format—the plain text box version—it will be upgraded into the Outline Unlimited version. (The old version will remain available as a deleted document in your project following this upgrade.)
    
-   All other projects in the same Series Folder will have access to that project’s outline
    
-   Sudowrite will add the project to your **Series Timeline**
    

### Series Timeline

Every Series Folder has a collapsible Series Timeline section at the top. As projects are added to the Series Folder, they will always be added to the “end” of the Series Timeline. (You can always grab the little handles beside the project title to drag it into its proper sequence.) Sudowrite uses this sequence information to assemble a timeline based on your project outlines, which will be used in subsequent generations inside of the series.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16e-1dc2-7072-865a-c1326eec78ef/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4be6f504e1b085682efafa78851ea7787d351ad8572ff49a414a9d624f0c095a)

You should only have to set this order once. Sudowrite will remember this order when generating content thereafter.

### Removing a Project from a Series

To remove a project from a Series simply move it out of the Series Folder, using the ••• menu and selecting the Move to… option. Alternatively, just drag the project up to the word Home (or the preferred folder name) in the File Path that appears above the series title.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/019be16e-6002-77a1-b7d8-dece67514ca4/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c4a5bd98d6041f74946239f5ff21c8df7de3ef70b7d603d8182bc90bc9bbed04)

When a project is removed from a Series, it loses real-time access to the shared Story Bible information… but we want to make sure that you don’t lose any hard work you’ve done, either in that Project or the rest of the series. So removing a project from a series works like this:

-   The project that is removed from the Series gets a copy of all shared Characters and Worldbuilding elements from the Series. Those are now specific to that project however, and changes to them will only be reflected within it.
    
-   The Series retains all of the shared Characters and Worldbuilding elements it had before the project was removed, regardless of whether they originated in the removed project or elsewhere.
    
-   The removed project loses access to Outlines from other books in the Series.
    
-   The series loses access to the Outline of the removed project.
    
-   The removed project will also be removed from the Series Timeline.
    

🚨**Warning!** Because projects retain shared Characters and Worldbuilding elements even when removed from a Series, you should avoid moving those projects _back_ into the same Series.

While identically-matched Characters and Worldbuilding elements will not be re-added, even nominally changed cards _would_ be re-added—which could potentially create a confusing mess of near-duplicates.

### Visualize

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 2540440-visualize
**ID:** 2540440
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:19:36.984Z

Visualize is a feature that brings your writing to life by generating images based on your text. Whether you're describing a character, setting a scene, or painting a vivid landscape with your words, Visualize transforms your descriptions into beautiful images—giving you a new perspective on your work.

### How to use Visualize

Visualize appears in the **More Tools** dropdown menu when you have text selected in your document. To use it, just select a passage of text (minimum 10 words, maximum 500) that contains descriptive content, click on More Tools and select **Visualize** from the list. Like other features, the AI will create a card in your History column on the right where you can see your results.

Once that image appears, you can click Insert to insert it directly into your document wherever your cursor is, Favorite it for future reference, or just right click and save it to your computer.

🔍**ICYMI:** Visualize only appears when you have text selected. Make sure your selection contains enough descriptive detail (at least 10 words) for the best results. Visualize works on up to a 500 word selection.

### What Does Visualize See?

Visualize looks first and foremost at the text that you’ve selected—but to improve your results, it will now also look at your Story Bible’s Character section if the operative passage mentions specific characters. Visualize tries to make sure that the images that it is generating match the Physical Description trait fields for any mentioned characters (though it will look at the _entire_ character card for broader context if a Physical Description trait is not detected).

### For best results from Visualize

The quality of your generated images depends a bit on the detail in your text. Here are some tips:

-   **Be specific:** Include colors, textures, lighting, and other visual details
    
-   **Set the scene:** Describe the environment and atmosphere
    
-   **Focus on the most important elements:** What do you want to stand out?
    
-   **Keep it cohesive:** Conflicting descriptions might result in unusual images
    

For example, instead of: "A castle on a hill."

Try: "A gothic stone castle perched on a misty green hill, its dark spires piercing the dawn sky, with stained glass windows glinting in the morning light."

Essentially, use the same descriptive language you’d use when trying to conjure an image in your reader’s mind for best results.

### Visualize Details

-   Generating an image with Visualize uses 2500 credits
    
-   Standard image resolution is 1024x1024 pixels
    
-   Minimum text selection: 10 words
    
-   Maximum text selection: 500 words

# **Write**

The Write feature is like the most advanced autocomplete ever. It works like this: Place your cursor at the end of some text, and then click Write. Sudowrite will continue it, picking up right where you left off.

To do this, Write looks back at the preceding text (up to 20,000 words) to gather context and pick up the thread. If your Story Bible is turned on (and filled out!) Write will also take into consideration your Style, Genre, Characters, Worldbuilding, and any linked Chapter Outline. Likewise, if you’ve linked your chapters in sequence, Write can make use of Chapter Continuity and read prior chapters before writing.

Write works best with a _minimum_ of 20 words (not counting the document’s title), so ideally there should always be at least a couple of sentences before the cursor… but the more words you provide, or the further into your document you use it, the better the results. Write can output anywhere from 50 to 2,000 words (you can tweak that number in your Write settings).

Click the 🔽 toggle to the right of Write to expand the Write menu. There you’ll find three different versions of Write— ✨ Auto, ↔️ Guided, and 🥸 Tone Shift—and the Write settings, which is where you’ll control settings for these features.

Once you’ve selected which Write mode you’d prefer, click the Write button within the text to use it. The suggestions will appear in the History column on the right. If you see a suggestion you like, click Insert to bring that prose into your document. This text will appear in **purple** until it's been edited by you. You’ll get the best results by regularly editing the purple text to make it your own, and fully incorporate it into your work.

Think of Write \*\*\*\*as a writing partner. Write or paste a scene or chapter of your own into the Editor, and use Write to send the story off in different directions. You’ll discover ideas and paths that will ultimately help enrich your story.

## ✨ Write - Auto

The Auto mode for Write relies the most on what is already written in the primary writing area, either ahead of the cursor or in prior chapters (via document linking). There is one other way to give it input, in Write Settings in the Key Details box, which is explained in that section.

Let’s try something, and type the following into the editor:

> Plates of cold food lined the dining room table at 54 Wimbley Avenue. Not a single pea or diced carrot was out of place. Which was odd, because

You’ll notice the last sentence is not finished. This is an advanced writing tip when you are cowriting with AI. By leaving a sentence open, your junior writing partner, Sudowrite, understands to continue the thought from there and keep writing!

Let’s keep the setting on ✨ **Auto** and click **Write.**

Sudowrite created 2 cards on the right side. They begin unstacked, so you can read the possible paths available, but if you click on the top (prompt portion) of the card, Sudowrite will collapse them down into a stack.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be135-9823-7c2e-899d-e1bb1c5fcb36/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=88d8e51cb8c2a3972126b0e10f43cb8cd7ad466235e45f9f609ace2e5c8eea8a)Advanced Tool Techniques

Write looks at what you've written and _continues_ it in the same style, voice, and format. Taking this into account, Write can help you with a number of creative tasks in your writing, including outlining, suggesting character traits, story themes, and much more. (These techniques work best in **Auto** mode.)

**OUTLINING**

Want help building out an outline for your story? Used creatively, Write can help! Start by giving Sudowrite a short summary of your story in several sentences. Then begin your outline and use Write after you've filled out the first few chapters or scenes.

Here's an example:

> \*Story summary: In a near-future San Francisco, an Indian-American doctor named Ruben performs genetic alterations for couples looking to have a child. Ruben enjoys his work but finds himself increasingly ethically conflicted as parents approach him with requests for modifications that he worries could be harmful to their children. He knows if he refuses, they'll just go get the job done by someone else. One day, he decides to forgo an agreed-upon genetic change and doesn't inform is clients. This decision haunts him and eventually extracts a high cost.
> 
> _OUTLINE_
> 
> _Scene 1: Ruben meets in his San Francisco office with a pair of new clients. They insinuate that they want their child to have genetic alterations that border on autism. Ruben tries to convince them otherwise but eventually agrees._
> 
> _Scene 2: Back home, Ruben watches his son doing his homework and thinks over the events of the day. He becomes angry as he considers his new clients' request. He decides not to honor it._
> 
> _Scene 3: Ruben is distracted all day, anxious that his subterfuge will be detected. But no one discovers it._
> 
> _Scene 4:_

By summarizing the story, then providing a scene-by-scene outline, we've given Write enough context to extrapolate ideas for where to go next. The consistent scene format tells Write what we're looking for, and by ending with "Scene 4: ", but not filling out that scene, we're strongly suggesting to Write that we'd like it to continue the outline we started.

As you fill out more of your outline, you can keep calling Write to continue it!

**EXPLORING CHARACTER BACKGROUND / THEMES**

Similar to the above example, we can exploit Write attempt to _continue_ what we've started to have it act as a brainstorming buddy for story and character ideas. Here's an example:

> Story summary: In a near-future San Francisco, an Indian-American doctor named Ruben performs genetic alterations for couples looking to have a child. Ruben enjoys his work but finds himself increasingly ethically conflicted as parents approach him with requests for modifications that he worries could be harmful to their children. He knows if he refuses, they'll just go get the job done by someone else. One day, he decides to forgo an agreed-upon genetic change and doesn't inform is clients. This decision haunts him and eventually extracts a high cost.
> 
> Some of the traits Ruben exhibits as a result of his Indian-American heritage and his training as a physician include:
> 
> \- Preference for self-sacrifice
> 
> \- Over-reliance on intellectual understanding
> 
> \-

Again, we've started our example with a high-level background of a story. But the difference here is the 'prompt' we want Write to continue at the end. This time, instead of a story outline we want Write to continue, we’re using a prompt that explores the traits of our main character.

As before, the formatting is important. Here we're using a bulleted list to imply we want several short responses, and we end with a dash and a space before starting Write, strongly suggesting we want Write to continue the list where we left off. We’ve ‘primed’ our list with a couple of character traits, but we could change those or even leave them off completely and see how Write reacts.

What if instead of character traits, we wanted to explore story themes? We could start with a summary and end with a ‘prompt’ listing potential story themes. When we call on Write, the suggestions it gives us can help brainstorm possible themes for our story.

**GIVING CONTEXT TO WRITE**

It can be helpful to add a preamble to your text to give additional context to Write. This is useful if there aren't many words for Write to work with (< 500) or what you're writing is in a very unique or esoteric style that Sudowrite may not have seen before.

Examples:

> The following is a scene from a surrealistic prose poem that explores consciousness through dada-esque phrases: We are the sun. The sun is us. But the dodo is full on traveling to the moon, who is seen to be resisting. To resist is to accept being resisted, of course. Imagine a dodo, as big as the sun, traveling to the moon, but running into a turris.
> 
> The moon is not always full. Nor is the sun full always. The moon is the tongue of the sun.

In all of these examples, because our use of Write is ‘off-label’, we can expect some variability in the quality of the output. **Use at your own risk**, experiment with your prompt, and try running Write several times to see if you get better results. Also, when trying to get Write to focus in a certain document for these types of use cases, be sure you’ve got Story Bible and/or Chapter Continuity turned off.

If you like what you get, be sure to **share your discoveries in the** [**Sudowrite Community Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/z9b3N4gyUM)**!**

One of our community members, Stephen Marche, collaborated with Write while writing their short story "The Thing on the Phone" published in the LA Review of Books: [https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-thing-on-the-phone/](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-thing-on-the-phone/)

🐸**Pro Tip:** Adding just a word or two to the beginning of the next sentence - even “The” can help Sudowrite get started in the right direction.

## ↔️ Write - Guided

Guided Write will write cards in two different ways. You can turn on Suggestions and Sudowrite will read the words in your document, up to 1,000 from where the cursor is, and suggest three story ideas that could come next in the story.

You also can write your own.

Let’s work with the same prompt as before.

Here is what we’ve entered into the editor:

> Plates of cold food lined the dining room table at 54 Wimbley Avenue. Not a single pea or diced carrot was out of place. Which was odd, because

Click on the 🔽 down arrow next to **Write** in the top left corner and Select **Guided**.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be13e-bf58-77c8-8cb7-9e5b8007bb76/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f494061efc95bdea129a337b98fdd3ba967705607798f7f4417515ad35589307)

The Write button will then instead say Write Guided. Now place your cursor at the end of your text, and click **Write Guided** in the top left corner.

**Guided Write** can offer 3 Suggestions of what could come next in the story. You turn on the Suggestions slider if you want Sudowrite to generate those Suggestions.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be13f-18d4-793d-84dd-0f92d560bb42/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=76e8c7444a28fa7675e418fa3ece20770476adfef686df5a64db24bfb5afb69b)

If you click on one of the suggestions, Sudowrite will create the number of cards and approximate lengths you chose in **Write Settings**.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be141-9881-70ef-88eb-21623352f416/b64u-Q2xlYW5TaG90IDIwMjYtMDEtMDggYXQgMTEuMzEuMzgucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=382586789e8714e9da1170729f1598dcc2fbfc99195a95d4bb4154baf52e005c)

Here is the prompt for the “Write you own” box in the image below:

> there’s a bright flash, and then a loud, apocalyptic explosion outside

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be142-e463-79d5-8b01-722942651c43/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8051241c8d245482934af66f91275efc10cd9de2ad01bd5234b91eb3ffdade18)

### Getting the most from Write’s Guided mode

In Guided mode, you can write a sentence or two to describe what should come next. Here’s what works best:

-   **Make it Believable** If your suggestion is too out of the blue, Sudowrite may have a hard time figuring out how to write it. For example, if you were writing a hardboiled detective story, and your guidance was for a magical genie to show up, Sudowrite may struggle to write that.
    
    -   Solution: Break your unbelievable idea into smaller, believable ideas. Maybe the detective finds a magic lamp, and then hears something coming from inside.
        
-   **Break up bigger ideas** Your suggestion should be doable in a couple paragraphs. For example, “The two slowly fall in love and eventually get married, have kids, and start a bakery together” may be too much to cover in one go.
    
    -   Solution: Break long ideas into small chunks. For example, just start with “The two agree to go on a date”, hit Write, then go again with the next part.
        

💡 **Try this!** Stop mid sentence

Guided mode will do a better job sticking to your story if you put the cursor mid-sentence before your click Write. This is because a period indicates to Sudowrite that a new idea should come next.

-   **Keep it simple** Simple sentences and repetition help Sudowrite understand what you want.
    
    -   Example: "Bill and Sophie get into a fight. After their fight, Sophie leaves." Because these instructions are short and clear, Sudowrite can easily understand that the fight is important, and that this is a sequence of **two separate actions**.
        

## 🥸 Write - Tone Shift

Tone Shift works a lot like Write’s Auto setting with one key difference—it changes the style of your writing in the process.

After clicking the Write 🔽 toggle, choose Tone Shift and then select from any of the following tones: Ominous, Fantastical, Fast-Paced, Upbeat, Authoritative, Conflicted, Romantic, Sensual. Then just put the cursor where you’d like to pick up the story from, and click the Write button. You’ll see the story continues along the vibes of what you’d selected.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be143-d30b-70b6-9abe-a46c2ad8b965/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e4e48bafed7a46577c3c55c38cf688c73e0ff8bf76326eabfac09fd1c41584d0)

## **Write Settings**

The last button under Write is for the Write Settings, which let you dictate how each Write feature should work.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/019be144-e24e-7989-a104-dd2aa5fca297/b64u-Q2xlYW5TaG90IDIwMjYtMDEtMDggYXQgMTEuMzguMTEucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=99744732fe21207ecc4bbcb7fcca049f74c728e0ec4fd085316fee47870f9e72)

### Creativity

The Creativity slider dictates how strictly the Write feature will stick to what you’ve already written. When the slider is at Least, this gives Sudowrite the least amount of flexibility to deviate from the prior context it read. It doesn’t mean the prose that Sudowrite comes up with is any less creative, instead the writing will just endeavor to match the arc of what is already in the document. Essentially, low creativity on this slider means the content of the response will be more predictable in line with what you’ve already written.

Pushing the slider all the way to Most gives Sudowrite a whole bunch of creative agency. Consider this a promotion for your junior writing partner; Sudowrite now has creative license to take your story down much more unexpected paths.

By default the slider is right in the middle. But where should you keep it? That’s up to you and what you need from Sudowrite for your story.

### Number of Cards

This drop down controls how many cards (or variants) are generated in your History column (on the right side) when you use a Write feature. You can set this anywhere from 1 to 6.

### Length of Cards

This drop down allows you to set a rough approximation of how long each individual card should be in a response. It ranges from ~50 words all the way up to ~1,500 words. There’s also a Max Words setting, which depends on the Prose Mode selected but could be up to 2,000 words. Each time Sudowrite generates a card, that’s a new pass at the request on the part of the AI, so the results will vary.

### Key Details

This section informs Write when it is in either Auto or Guided mode. It’s also worth noting Key Details is a setting for the entire Project (🗂️) rather than a Document (📄) level setting. Key Details **does not** affect Canvas or Story Bible.

As you move between documents in your Project, make sure to either turn off Key Details or change the information it contains if its contents do not apply to the scene you’re working on.

Great things to put into Key Details:

-   how you want the prose written such as “romantic” or “foreboding”
    
-   what heat level or intensity you want romance or violence scenes to be written
    
-   what genre are you writing in, keep in mind you might need to define newer genres or abbreviations to Sudowrite like “reverse harem” or “mpreg”
    
-   character names and brief details that are needed for the story, such as “Logan’s right arm was broken ten minutes before this scene happens, he is feeling incredible pain”
    
-   setting details that you want worked in such as “grand English country estate”
    
-   _and anything else you can think of, write in here like you would give notes to a junior writing partner!_
    

### What Does the Write Button See?

Write doesn’t just see the words just before your cursor anymore. Both Auto and Guided Write look at a bunch of context from your project, and take that all into consideration before writing for you Things that Write may reference as input context includes:

-   **Preceding Text**: Up to 20,000 words from the current document before the cursor
    
-   **Previous Document Text**: Up to 20,000 words total from linked chapters
    
    -   Up to 25 documents in the chain, working backwards from the current doc
        
-   **Key Details**: Anything you’ve written in the Key Details field
    
-   **POV**: Point of view setting (e.g., "1st person", "3rd person close", "3rd person omniscient", etc.). This may included the Character name for POV perspective.
    
-   **Tense**: Tense setting (e.g., past tense, present tense)
    
-   **\[Guided Only\] Guidance**: User-provided plot point or writing direction
    
-   Story Bible (when turned on), including:
    
    -   **Genre**: Selected genre(s) for the story
        
    -   **Style**: Writing style guidelines
        
    -   **Synopsis**: Story synopsis
        
    -   **Outline Chapter Summary**: Details on the linked chapter from the Outline
        

📓 **Write transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Write video above is available by expanding this toggle.

This is the third installment in our Quick Start series, and today we’ll look at the Write button.

The Write button is like the most advanced autocomplete you’ve ever used—it looks at what you’ve written up to wherever the cursor is (as well as a few other things we’ll discuss), and then continues writing for you.

By default the Write button will generate two “cards”—those are the AI suggestions, and they’ll show up in the History column on the right.

If you like one of them, just use the Insert button to pop it into your story. AI-generated words show up in purple like this, until you modify them.

If you don’t want to use it immediately, but like it enough that you may want to refer back to it later, use the star button.

Starred cards show up in this column after toggling from the History clock icon to the Star icon.

You can get pretty far using the stock Write button, which we call Auto, but if you want to try other modes, click this little arrow dropdown to the right of Write.

This opens the Write Menu, where you can customize the way the Write button works—here you’ll see a few additional options, including guided, tone shift, and write settings.

Guided Write gives you a little bit more directional control. You can get at a glance suggestions for continuation paths, or suggest your own—when you see something you like, you can ask for a completion to appear in your History column.

Tone shift works like Auto, but you’re choosing the style of the continuation you’d like to see.

Finally, the Write settings are where you can totally customize the way Write works.

You can change the number of cards generated with each click, and their length,

you can play with this slider to get more or less creative results,

and you can even choose the prose mode—that option determines exactly which AI will be doing the writing. They all have different styles and capabilities. Some are more economical than others when it comes to using credits. We encourage you to experiment and see what works for you.

Key details down here is a way to get the Write button to remember something important. So for example, if your story takes place on Mars, it’d probably be good to jot that down so the AI doesn’t mention bright blue skies. There’s one other place that the Write button can draw context about your story from—and that’s Story Bible.

That’s a topic for another day, but just keep in mind that you don’t have to put your full character list in key details, since the Write button will probably be getting that from your Story Bible.

I’d mentioned in the last video that there’s technically a fourth simple way to get started—and that’s using the write button in a totally blank document. Write will write something… basically whatever the AI wants to write… it’s sort of fun as a story starter, but definitely not the most practical.

That pretty much covers the Write button. Let us know what questions you have in the comments, and stay tuned for next time when we discuss Rewrite.

## Plugins

### How do I build Plugins?

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 1671769-how-do-i-build-plugins
**ID:** 1671769
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:15:03.055Z

## **Creating Plugins**

Roll up your sleeves and start making some Plugins of your own—for yourself or everyone on Sudowrite! If you know some basics when it comes to writing prompts for AI, building your first Plugin will be easy.

But before you get started, make sure to set your profile name to what you want publicly displayed. You can do so by clicking the Settings Gear icon in the upper right of Sudowrite and clicking Edit next to the name that appears in the top left of that popup. Whatever you set here is what will show up as the Creator Name on Plugins you Publish to the Directory.

To get started, click on the **Create Plugin** button in the **More Tools** dropdown, or else on the right of the Plugins Directory. Either way, you’ll be put into the plugin creation flow.

### The Magic Plugin Builder

We’ve simplified the plugin creation flow so that you can just describe what exactly you’d like a plugin to do.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/019be1bc-c65b-76d3-aa84-99000686be31/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=02e98d2949e595af6936d3de0e57e2c117357659be8d0ea982410a088cae6698)

To use it, enter a plain text description of what sort of writing tool you’re looking for and click Generate Plugin. Remember that plugins can do any of three things: generate, analyze, or transform text. (The Magic Plugin Builder won’t create multi-stage plugins by default, but it’s worth noting that you can create a 2-stage plugin in case you’d like to do any of those things in sequence too!)

The Magic Plugin Builder will then create everything your plugin needs to work—a Title, a Description, a category, and Prompts (both System and User prompting). It will also have a default AI model assigned (GPT-4o), but it’s important to note that **you can change anything that was created for you**. This is just the fastest way to get to a rough draft of the writing tool you need.

### What Makes a Plugin?

Whether you use the Magic Plugin Builder or choose Skip, you’ll wind up in the Plugin Editor. This editor gives you granular control over how your Plugin works.

Here’s a look at some of the essential fields (some of which will be populated if you chose to let Sudowrite create your Plugin for you):

1.  **Name** - This is your Plugin’s name, and how it will be labeled in the directory should you choose to publish it. The name should be succinct, and clearly communicate what the Plugin does since this will also be how you identify the Plugin in the More Tools dropdown.
    
2.  **Description** - This is a description of what the Plugin does and how it works. It’s best to include specifics of how to use it—whether it needs a highlight, prompts a user in a text field, or otherwise. Depending on the Plugin, it may make sense to include an example input and output response.
    
3.  **Visibility** **Settings** - You can choose to Publish your Plugin to the Directory or keep it Unlisted. Unlisted plugins do not show up in the Directory or search results, but you can still use them—and anyone with the direct URL would also be able to see/install the Plugin.
    
    1.  **Instructions Visibility** - You can also choose to expose the instructions of your Plugin. This would make the System and User prompting visible on the Plugins description page.
        
4.  **Category** - Choose a single option from the options available to categorize your Plugin according to _what it is for_—anything from _Analysis & Feedback_ to _World-Building_. This will determine where the Plugin appears on the Explore page.
    
    _The Categories currently available are:_
    
    **Narrative & Plot** - Plugins that focus on creating and/or enhancing the plot.
    
    **Character Development** \- Plugins that assist in crafting and refining characters.
    
    **Editing & Revision** \- Plugins that improve the writing style and prose.
    
    **Scene Enhancement** - Plugins that help with improving or modifying a scene.
    
    **World-Building** - Plugins that aid in creating immersive and detailed fictional worlds. **Analysis & Feedback** - Plugins dedicated to providing in-depth evaluations and feedback on written content.
    
    **Marketing** \- Plugins designed to aid authors in promoting and distributing their work to a broader audience.
    
    **Genre-Specific** - Plugins that provide guidance and/or prompts tailored to specific genres, such as romance, horror, or young adult fiction.
    
    **Multi-Lingual** - Plugins that help with translation or are narrative tools that are language specific.
    
5.  **Input Options** - You have a couple of toggles that allow you to Adjust Inputs (in order to set minimum or maximum words the Plugin can be used on) or Allow Users to Give Instructions (which would let you configure a popup that appears when the plugin is used).
    
6.  **Prompts** - This is where you tell the AI exactly what to do. When a user uses your Plugin, the AI will read these instructions and any information the instructions point at (in the form of variables, described below). Be precise with your instructions, as if it were written for an assistant who cannot ask you follow-up questions while they are doing the task.
    

> **Good to Know**
> 
> Plugins use _the user’s_ **credits** when used, just like other Sudowrite features. Using the default AI model for Plugins means they’ll generally be pretty cost effective (but they could get expensive if you decide to use the complete contents of someone’s Story Bible as context).
> 
> Once you start changing the AI model and experimenting with your own variables, credit costs may vary. Be sure to test your Plugins for a sense of how much they’ll cost to use!

Here’s what each of the areas in the screenshot above controls:

1.  **Preceding Text** - Preceding Text is a variable representing the words before the cursor. In Basic Plugins this works as a fallback, reading the words before the cursor if the Plugin user had not highlighted anything. If you plan on using `{{ preceding_text }}` then you may want to specify the minimum and/or maximum number of words needed before the cursor for the Plugin to work here.
    
2.  **Highlighted Text** - Highlighted Text is a variable representing the words the user has highlighted—this will be replaced by the exact words the user has highlighted when the Plugin is run, passing that context into the prompt. If you plan on using `{{ highlighted_text }}` you can specify the minimum words required and maximum allowed for a highlight here.
    
3.  **Previous Document Text** - If the Plugin user has linked documents in their project in order to take advantage of Chapter Continuity, the `{{ previous_document_text }}` variable will allow the plugin access to that readback (up to the limits specified here).
    
4.  **User Text Input** - If you toggle on _Allow Users to Give Instructions_, you also enable the `{{ user_text_input }}` variable. With this feature enabled, your Plugin users will get a popup window before the Plugin is actually run, prompting them for input according to instructions you’ve defined. Inserting this variable in your Plugin instructions is a way to directly pass in end user input.
    

> **Available Variables** - In addition to the Input Options mentioned above (which have their own configurator inside of the Plugin builder) there are a bunch of additional variables available to enrich your custom Plugins.
> 
> `{{ previous_document_text }}` - The text from all previous documents in the chain of previous documents. This takes advantage of a user’s chapter continuity.
> 
> `{{ braindump }}` - The braindump from the story bible.
> 
> `{{ genre }}` - The genre from the user’s story bible.
> 
> `{{ style }}` - The style from the user’s story bible.
> 
> `{{ synopsis }}` - The synopsis from the user’s story bible.
> 
> `{{ characters }}` - The characters from the user’s story bible, optimized by the Saliency engine to only include textually relevant character data.
> 
> `{{ characters_raw }}` - All of the character data from the story bible, raw, unoptimized.
> 
> `{{ outline }}` - The outline from the story bible.
> 
> `{{ scene_summary }}` - The section of the outline linked with the current document a plugin is being used within, if any.
> 
> `{{ is_story_bible_active }}` - Information as to whether or not story bible is toggled on. `{{ chapter_scenes }}` - The Scenes from the story bible.
> 
> `{{ chapter_scenes_extra_instructions }}` - The Extra Instructions that a user has opted to include in their Draft box.
> 
> `{{ worldbuilding }}` - The worldbuilding entries from the story bible, optimized by the Saliency engine to only include what is textually relevant.
> 
> `{{ worldbuilding_raw }}` - The worldbuilding entries from the story bible, raw, unoptimized.

1.  **Prompts -** By default an Advanced Plugin has a simple Prompt area—**Prompt 1**. Inside of that box you can specify the exact instructions and LLM you’d like.
    
    1.  **System** - This specifies how the AI should behave. For instance, a system message could be: "You are a helpful assistant." This instructs the model to behave like a helpful assistant during the chat.
        
    2.  **User** - This is the substance of your plugin. Here, you will combine the user’s `{{ highlighted_text }}` and possibly the Story Bible data into a prompt for the language model to produce the desired functionality for the user. A few guidelines:
        
        -   Give a strong cue as to what part of the prompt is the user’s highlighted text, which will let the AI know what part is coming from the user. Something like:
            
        
        \`Here is a passage of text:
        
        {{ highlighted\_text }}
        
        Based on the passage of text provided, \[...rest of instructions...\]\`
        
        -   Be as specific as you can with your instructions. A good approach is to write this as if you’re writing an email to an assistant for them to do the task correctly on the first try without requiring clarifying questions.
            
        -   If prompt rewrites the user’s highlighted text, specify at the end how long the rewrite should be. If it should be rewriting into approximately the same number of words, say so, like `ONLY REWRITE THE PASSAGE, DO NOT MAKE IT LONGER`
            
        -   The genre, style, synopsis, characters, and outline are available as variables as well, allowing you to inject Story Bible data to influence the prompt.
            
    3.  **AI Options** - These options changes the behavior of the language model selected.
        
        1.  **Engine** - You can select from several different AI models. We believe `gpt-4o-mini` is sufficient for most tasks—but much more capable (albeit slower and more expensive) models exist, such as `gpt-4.1` and even `gemini-2.5-pro` which is capable of reading entire manuscripts.
            
        2.  **Temperature** - Think of this as the "creativity" dial. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the model's responses more random and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes them more focused and deterministic. Ranges from `0` to `1.0`. We recommend `0.85` for most use cases.
            
        3.  **Frequency Penalty** - Controls how much the model avoids or prefers frequently used words or phrases. A negative value makes it more likely to use frequent words, while a positive value makes it avoid them. It's like asking a writer to avoid clichés: a positive value tells them to be more original and not use common phrases, while a negative value lets them use those familiar phrases freely.
            
        4.  **Presence Penalty** - This adjusts the model's inclination to include new ideas or topics. A positive value encourages it to introduce new concepts, while a negative value makes it stick more closely to the topics already mentioned. Imagine instructing a teacher: a positive value tells them to bring up new topics often, while a negative one tells them to stay on the current topic.
            
        5.  **Stop** - This parameter lets you specify words that, when generated by the model, will make it stop generating any further. For instance, if you set "stop" to be ".", the model would stop generating text as soon as it produces a period. It's like giving a speaker a cue: "When you mention this word or symbol, wrap up your speech.”
            
        6.  **Number of Generations** The number of cards your plugin should generate. Each card is an independent “run” of your plugin, and do not affect each other. Specifying more than one is useful if you want to give the user a diverse set of options to choose from. (Note: multi-stage prompts require this to be 1)
            
        7.  **Max Tokens** - This determines the maximum number of tokens the model will produce in its output (where a token is roughly 0.75 words). For example, if you set "max tokens" to 50, the model will not generate a response longer than 50 tokens.
            
2.  **Multi-Stage Prompts** - To create multi-stage prompts—which are essentially two of these in sequence—you can click on the “+ Prompt” button at the bottom, which will create a new prompt. The second stage is exactly the same as the first, except now you have access to a new variable `{{ prompt_1_result }}` which will be the output from the first prompt. This is great if you’d like to run an analysis, and the use that analysis to run an edit or text transformation in the following prompt.
    
    1.  Note that while you will see the prompt 1 result in testing, only the end result of the second prompt will be output to a card in the user’s History when a live Plugin is used. This means users will not see the intermediate prompt results. (In the example above, the end user would not see the analysis, only the transformed text.)
        

## **Testing Plugins**

At the bottom of the Plugin creation page, you will see a testing area:

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/019be1c2-dd67-720a-ba57-51f1317b3af8/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=21812995dd7a466df002a68938cf28cdca0e83571e8556336309a8da6a336ed7)

This lets you easily and quickly test your Plugin without publishing it. It’s essential that you test your plugin to make sure it works with a diverse set of inputs—and that you’re getting the results you want out of it. We suggest that you have a bank of inputs along with an idea what your expected output is. This way, as you iterate on the design of your plugin, you can make sure that the functionality matches your expectations.

Toggling Additional Variables exposes fields to populate Preceding Text as well as any Story Bible test data (in case your Plugin makes use of those). Note that we’ve pre-populated some Story Bible context for quick testing, but you can replace that with more tailored inputs for better results. (If you notice your Plugin is talking a lot about Bigfoot in testing, it’s possible you’re passing in this context without realizing it!)

## Creator Name

You can edit what name shows up for your Plugins by clicking on the small “Edit” link in the Settings (⚙️) menu in top right of your Sudowrite interface:

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/019be1c3-1db8-74dd-9099-141561098fc6/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5f5f5cccf7a8fcd976774a8ffc9c232ffa06032ef6bdddba820566a45a06e216)

By default, if you’ve logged in via Google, that will be set to your Google display name.

Example Plugin

Now let’s run through an example - let’s make a Plugin that summarizes the user’s highlighted passage into specific plot points. We’ll use the Basic Editor like so:

**Name** - `Summarize Plot Points`

_This name makes it clear to the user what the plugin does. It also uses the active voice, which makes it more suited as an action in the dropdown._

**Description**

```
This plugin summarizes the highlighted text, focusing on story plot points. These plot points could be used as part of an outline, input to Story Engine beats, or for your own notes about a scene. Example Usage Input: Hours later, we had gotten used to the roar, and people had stopped stirring. I heard a soft thumping sound, which I took as another piece of debris glancing off the dome top. But then, a musty smell hit my nostrils. A swell of dust blew in from under the antechamber door, followed by another thump, a deep tone that rang from under the dome. “What was that?” Rosa said. “The passage,” Yan-Yan said. Inside the chamber, a musty smell hung in the air, and silt stung my eyes. It piled around our legs. Rosa shuddered. “What’s happening?” “Pressure differential.” I knew the dust meant the passage must have collapsed. We huddled and watched the trap door disgorge a concoction of sand and dirt. A faint voice called out, like it was coming from the end of a tin can phone. Yan-Yan slapped the ground. “Jack! Stay where you are, we’re coming!” Tina knelt down with her. “Who’s Jack?” “Her son,” I said. “He’s in the smaller dome, across the way.” I tapped a control panel on the wall, and it immediately blinked an angry red. Power totally out at Dome 2. I switched to the outside camera. Something had taken a chunk out of the dome. Yan-Yan’s eyes were wide. “Oh my god.” “I thought you said it’d withstand,” Ben said. A million niggling edge cases stabbed my mind. Perhaps I should have reinforced the pole trusses. Or maybe the ventilation system wasn’t properly sealed. Too late now. “I’ll get him,” I said. “I’m going with you,” Yan-Yan said, her fists clenched and shaking. I shook my head. “Not with your leg.” The wind dial was cracking 120. “Does Jack have his gear?” “Yes, but he’s still too light,” she said. She was right. I reckoned he was sixty pounds. Would blow away without being tethered. If the wind cracks 150, even I wouldn’t be able to walk outside. I needed someone to go with me. Output: 1. Characters are inside a dome when a disturbance, signaled by a musty smell and dust, occurs. 2. Rosa and Yan-Yan identify the disturbance as coming from a collapsed passage. 3. A faint voice from the second dome is recognized as Yan-Yan's son, Jack. 4. Surveillance reveals significant damage to the second dome, prompting concern and regret about the dome's design. 5. The protagonist decides to rescue Jack, with Yan-Yan eager to join despite her injury. 6. The outside environment's strong winds pose a serious threat to the rescue mission, especially considering Jack's light weight. 
```

Here, we describe clearly what the plugin does, and also give the user context on when it could be useful. We also give an example input and output, which will help the user understand how this plugin could fit into their workflow.

**Prompt**

```
Summarize this passage into story plot points that would be suitable as part of a story outline. Keep the number of plot points succinct. You should format the output into a numbered list. 
```

We make sure to give specific instructions so that the AI knows what kind of output is expected. A good way to approach writing these instructions is to think about what you’d have to write in an email to an assistant to make sure they get the job done without needing to ask clarifying questions.

### How do I use Plugins?

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 7448323-how-do-i-use-plugins
**ID:** 7448323
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T19:05:35.024Z

## Finding Plugins

The Plugins Directory is available under the **More Tools** dropdown menu in your toolbar.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/019be1b8-2ef5-734e-9593-6666d04b5db4/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d24aa0ae416946ee087dbfd104081b21c7f1e9b5dcaf17ae18d22500a202d062)

## Adding Plugins

The Plugins Directory page lists all of the available Plugins.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/019be1b8-76f4-79a1-bd10-607934ed3558/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8c110aa15e69929968e0b89cdccf4f0bbfe7b107005ea24133cd532268a08df9)

You can select Categories along the left to view Plugins according to their category, and you can use the filter views available to sort by Popular (most installed) or Newest (most recently published). Note that you also have filter views available for Plugins you’ve added or built.

To add a plugin, just click the **Add** button on the Plugin’s info card. You can also click into the card to visit the Plugin’s detailed description page and read more about it, before choosing to **Add** it from there.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/019be1b9-16b4-768c-8f29-c061d977c42f/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=3d0820a0ee602bf0aee5ec58bc160401fe22916a502f26e9426fc876217d11c3)

The Description page includes details on the creator, how many users it has, an estimation of how many credits it might use, and a Description written by the creator. The Description should give you a good idea of what the Plugin is intended to do, and ideally how to use it.

Some creators may choose to make their Plugin **Instructions** visible, and if they’ve done so, those will appear on this page as well. Instructions are essentially the AI System and User prompt that is shared with the AI model they selected to power their plugin.

In the upper right, you’ll see a **Copy Link** button (if you’d like to share the Plugin) and an Add button, which will install it. To use the Plugin, you’ll have to click **Add**. (You’ll also see an Edit button if it’s one of your Plugins.)

Once you’ve added a Plugin, you will see it available in all of your projects under the **More Tools** dropdown in the top right of your toolbar.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/019be1b9-8780-7755-b13f-02ff94198234/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=bd1837be09a57c0f843477229117ff4d2b320c3d091bcd8998fc3374cffa9fe0)

To use a Plugin, just select it from this dropdown.

💡Select **Reorder this Menu** from the **More Tools** dropdown to rearrange that dropdown list. You can even move your most frequently-used Plugins to your actual Toolbar, replacing features like Write and Rewrite!

**Take note: The Plugins you install may work in one of many different ways.** They may require you to highlight text, or put your cursor somewhere in particular, or even write something in a field that will appear on click. Some Plugins might even ask you to structure the text in your document in a particular way, or write specific text (sometimes in a specific format) and highlight _that_. It’s important to familiarize yourself with how an installed Plugin works (again, on the Description page) before using it in order to achieve the best results.

Plugins output to the History column on the right, just like other Sudowrite features. And just like with those features, you can favorite, insert, and copy these cards as desired.

### Plugins Guidelines

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 5603490-plugins-guidelines
**ID:** 5603490
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:18:08.396Z

Plugins unlock custom functionality on Sudowrite, empowering our writer community to build and share totally custom tools. With great power comes great responsibility though, so here are some guidelines as to what we expect from our community when it comes to building and sharing Plugins.

## What Plugins Are For

The Plugins drop-down in your toolbar is like a Swiss Army Knife, only _you_ get to decide the tools you’ll fill it with. You can do so by adding Plugins from the Explore page or by building them yourself.

Generally speaking, **we expect Plugins to enhance or enrich the writing process**. This might mean making it easier, faster, more creative, or more joyful. Plugins may be used for analysis, generation, interpretation, or even to accomplish specialized writing techniques. We don’t want to be overly prescriptive about what you should make though! Our main advice is to reflect on your workflow and get creative.

## **Best Practices**

Here are a few helpful guidelines to keep in mind as you build:

✅ **Use short, descriptive titles.** The Plugin’s title will show up in the Plugins drop-down, so short and sweet helps the UX.

✅ **Keep Plugin titles and descriptions PG-13.** Use NSFW designations when merited.

**✅ Be clear about the input necessary.** Not everyone will read your Plugin’s full prompt, so try to say how it works in the description. (Ex. “Highlight at least 200 words.”)

**✅ Be clear about the expected output.** Say exactly what a user should expect to get out of using your Plugin—whether that’s an analysis, finished prose, multiple cards, or something else. (Ex. “This Plugin will generate two separate cards of prepared prose.)

**✅ Share what you build!** You’re encouraged to Publish and share the Plugins you’ve built. But also…

❌ **Leave broken Plugins Unlisted.** It can take a little experimentation to get a Plugin working just right. If it’s not working as described or intended, leave it Unlisted until it is.

❌ **Try not to delete Plugins people depend on.** Deleting a Plugin altogether will remove it for everyone who has ever added it. That might break things for others who have come to depend on it, so default to toggling it to Unlisted if necessary.

## Dealbreakers

This part should be obvious, but to keep everyone safe **we don’t allow Plugins that are dangerous, hateful, or illegal**.

You can view the list of prohibited uses here.

**Plugins can not…**

❌ Promote services or products in a spammy or disruptive manner.

❌ Create or distribute harmful/malicious content/software.

❌ Steal or infringe on intellectual property rights.

❌ Promote hate or discrimination.

❌ Do any other stuff that’s illegal or in violation of our Terms of Use.

## Help One Another

As you discover and experiment with Plugins, you may encounter Plugins that don’t work as described. If you’re able to find the creator in Discord, let them know so they have the opportunity to fix it up. Otherwise, you can let _us_ know, and we can toggle it to Unlisted until we can get in touch with them.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f2435fa13de851a1465/019be1c7-10c6-7ae1-b25c-f5cd2fbd6949/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=196d4d82606acd1b96907d96f0e6a62d67210d0b636c7882ebaad35f06c16ea2)

### What are Plugins?

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 0953803-what-are-plugins
**ID:** 0953803
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:00:47.652Z

## What are Plugins?

Sudowrite Plugins allow you to create powerful, custom AI functions for anyone on Sudowrite to use. Here’s a brief video introduction to Plugins.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are custom features, that allow Sudowrite to do cool new things it couldn’t do otherwise. Think of them a little like browser extensions, which expand the capability of your web browser. Your web browser doesn’t necessarily come with an ad blocker, or a password manager, but you can install extensions that do those things.

Plugins work similarly. If there’s ever a tool you need that doesn’t appear to be a feature of Sudowrite, you can find a Plugin, or even build your own custom Plugin, to tackle it. It’s a way to dial in your dream workflow. You may want to share these with the community in our directory, or if they’re super specific to your process you can keep them unlisted while still using them yourself.

## What can Plugins do?

Basically _anything_ an author might want to do… but saying “anything you want” is not very instructive! Instead, it may be helpful to know the three major functions a Plugin might serve:

**Writing** - Plugins can generate text according to your instructions.

**Editing** - Plugins can transform text according to your instructions.

**Analysis** - Plugins can analyze text according to your instructions.

But the thing that makes Plugins super powerful is that they can also do any combination of these things. So maybe you want to analyze a chapter of your work according to a set of rules you have for yourself. A Plugin could do that and generate an analysis for your reference—or you could have it generate the analysis, and then make the edits to the text directly based on that analysis.

Plugins are super flexible!

## Story Bible

### Braindump

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 9784768-braindump
**ID:** 9784768
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:12:20.183Z

## Setting up your story

good news: You don't have to stress out about your brain dump. You can put absolutely anything you want in this field, but here are a few pointers on what you may want to include to get the most out of it:.

## Braindump

Imagine that you’re meeting with another writer who will collaborate with you on your story.

You’re meeting them for the first time, and they have zero context. The Braindump section is what you’d tell this writer in order to introduce them to the core elements on your story. It’s part elevator pitch, part “everything I know for sure.”

This could be a sentence, a paragraph, a snippet of a scene, or any free-form passage of text. The more information you put in Braindump, the better picture the AI will have of your vision.

**We recommend writing at least a few hundred words here**. You can always revise Braindump later as story elements change.

🧠 Braindump directly influences the generation of Synopsis. Otherwise, if the Synopsis is never filled in or generated, fields that are typically informed by Synopsis will defer to the Braindump.

### Characters

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 1726763-characters
**ID:** 1726763
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:24:48.375Z

The Characters section is where you define the characters in your story. This affects how the characters are described, how their dialogue is written, what choices they make, and how they interact with each other. Once you’ve completed your synopsis, Story Bible can create all of your characters for you.

**To tell Story Bible to create your Characters, click the Generate All Characters button.**

When you generate characters, Story Bible will take what you’ve written in your Synopsis and use it to generate the main characters in your story. Characters explicitly mentioned in your Synopsis will automatically be included. If you don’t mention any specific characters in your Synopsis, or if you only mention a few, Story Bible will create additional characters for your consideration. You can leave these characters as-is, or ideally, change the substance of their character cards.

🧠 Characters are generated based on the Synopsis. Meanwhile, the Characters section directly influences the generation of your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

### Character Cards

**Each character receives their own card in the Characters section of your Story Bible.**

Cards are how you keep track of each individual character and their details. Cards can be collapsed with the arrow next to the characters name, and dragged to your preferred order with the six-dot handle in the upper left.

The dropdown in the upper right allows you to set a Characters role (for example, protagonist, supporting character, etc.). You can see previous versions of the character in the card history—accessed from the clock icon up top—and you can delete a character card using the three dots on the right.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/019be192-8b27-7da9-b739-f8ce854a9fe4/b64u-Q2xlYW5TaG90IDIwMjYtMDEtMTMgYXQgMTguMDkuMjIgMkAyeC5wbmc.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c7eba4610a926802abf4d8ef1fac04e086c27b0dc7859df7bcabfbcb98386cba)

By default, each Character card created includes the following traits: Pronouns, Groups, Other Names, Personality, Background, Physical Description, and Dialogue Style.

### Adding Characters

There are three ways to add characters. Click **\+ Add Character** in the Characters header section of Story Bible, and choose from:

**Blank Character -** This creates a blank character card (with either the default traits, or the custom defaults you’ve assigned) for you to manually complete.

**Generate Character** - This option opens a small prompt window that allows you to ask for a certain _type_ of character. This field is very flexible, and you can be as vague or as specific as you’d like.

**Try this:** Ask for a mentor character, or an antagonist to your existing protagonist, in the Generate Character box. You can even paste a lengthy character braindump here for a character you already have notes on. Sudowrite’s AI will further develop the character based on your notes, and refine it so that it fits your default card traits.

**Surprise Me** - This option will instantly generate a random character to round out your cast. Your existing Characters and storyline are taken into consideration and the AI will try to create something that compliments the existing cast. You can add or generate as many characters as you’d like.

### Character Traits

Most of the default traits are pretty self-explanatory. Personality, Background, Physical Description, and Dialogue Style all help an author distinguish characters from one another and add richer detail to their writing.

But traits are there both for _your_ reference, _and_ that of the AI. **Traits inform how the AI will write a character anywhere that character appears.** And since AI depends on specificity, some traits are _primarily_ for the benefit of the AI.

If your character belongs to a group—say for example that they’re in a D&D group called The Hellfire Club—you’d want to include that group name under **Groups**. That way, if you reference The Hellfire Club in a scene, the AI knows which characters may be involved.

The same goes for **Other Names**. Be sure to include any of your character’s nicknames, pet names, or pseudonyms in Other Names, so that the AI understands who you’re referring to at all times (—for example, when you write Tommy in Chapter 6 and you’re actually referring to the character card for Thomas Culligan).

### Trait Customization

Traits aren’t set in stone. You can retitle existing traits, or even **create custom traits at the individual character level _or_ at the default level**.

**Need to add a one-off trait to a character?** (For example, maybe you need a “Bat Form Physical Description” for your vampiric protagonist.) Just click **\+ Add Trait** at the bottom of that character card, title the trait, and then fill out the empty field with details.

**Want all of your characters—or even a specific character type—to have additional traits?** Click the **Customize** button under the **More menu (•••)** at the top of the Characters section and you can edit and rearrange your default traits for each Character type. You can even create brand new custom Character types with specific trait sets!

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/019be193-2662-7686-a246-9e905018fdd8/b64u-Q2xlYW5TaG90IDIwMjYtMDEtMTMgYXQgMTguMjQuMTdAMngucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c50c5fac3dc1d6af64ea916a29bb069cff5c740b2386a355a3435e24147eb78e)

Just click **\+ Add** to add a new default trait, and all future characters will be created with that default trait included. This is ideal if you’d like to add your characters’ Enneagram types, core wounds, or story-specific details (like shifter form, for example).

When adding new defaults, you have the option to create fields for those traits across all existing characters. Just note that if you choose to add them on every existing character card, the newly created fields will need to be manually filled out. Freshly-generated characters on the other hand will include the updated defaults, with those trait fields populated on generation.

### Generating Traits

After adding new default traits to pre-existing Character cards or Worldbuilding elements, you may wind up with a bunch of empty trait fields. Traits can always be filled in manually, but sometimes you want the AI’s help with that, so you have the ability to generate traits individually as well.

**When a trait field is empty, just put your cursor inside of the field and click _Generate_.** You’ll have the option to provide custom instructions, but you can also just click **_Go_**. The AI will then populate that trait field with something contextually appropriate.

The AI takes the rest of your Characters, Worldbuilding elements, and Story Bible context into consideration when generating those traits individually.

You also have the option to Rewrite trait fields that you’re not satisfied with. Just **click Rewrite from within the trait field**, provide custom instructions (if desired), and click Go. The AI looks at the current version of the trait, then rewrites it either according to provide instructions or (if blank) its own intuition and context.

### Character Data

Story Bible’s updated characters section has more structured character data than ever. But **which of Sudowrite’s features make use of your Character data**?

Your characters section is referenced by the Draft tool for the creation of both Scenes and prose generation. Characters are also referenced by the Write button’s Auto and Guided Write modes. And both Quick Edit and Chat can see your characters as well—try asking Chat about any of your character details.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/019be195-0304-7672-880f-e153ebb1247d/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9105284b3e85f034e24be0ed1394b5a004bac34e4ab5bd13f5312be066e843e9)

You can fit an absurd amount of data on each Character card, and Story Bible won’t ever stop you from adding new Characters. You may see the Characters section referred to as unlimited—but that’s not _entirely_ true. **If you try to add more than 2,000 different characters to your Story Bible you’ll actually hit the limit!** But if you have more than 2,000 characters… well, have you considered you may actually be writing _a phone book_?

### Importing or Exporting Characters

Sometimes you want to pick up on a work in progress, or just create character cards using the notes you’ve already assembled on your characters.

The smart import feature in Story Bible’s Characters section can be used to instantly create Character cards from an existing text.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/019be195-4862-72bf-b271-36b9b017a0b2/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6e7c0d47f2b1f8fc3968d8cd41bb6493f8dac7ad4c2a91e7f8bdff251a3ef495)

To use the smart import feature, navigate to the header of the Characters section of Story Bible and click the Import button in the three dots (•••) menu. Doing so opens the Import window.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/019be195-8967-74b8-a93c-9eb046a141e9/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7b9e8d8889f54f77dcf5d22a9eab3be3d1b25c958bb28d7f60d5a2fcc2f53d8d)

You have the option of importing characters from text or a file. This might be a list of characters, a chapter of your work, or in some cases an entire manuscript.

The raw text pasted in or file uploaded should be no more than 60,000 words. Sudowrite will review that, identify, and import up to 30 characters at a time. Before doing so there is a brief validation step where you can tell Sudowrite not to bother bringing a character in (for example, where it identifies a pseudonym or nickname as a distinct character).

ℹ️ The Characters section smart import will accept any of the following file types: .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .odt, .csv

Importing characters does not use credits.

### How will Characters be created using the Smart Import?

For "unstructured text" that you paste in or upload by file, Sudowrite will use AI to first identify the characters, and then figure out how best to complete the defined default trait fields.

However, when uploading a CSV, you’re actually not subject to the limits outlined above—you could import more than 30 characters in one shot, if desired. That’s because Sudowrite skips AI if you upload structured data via CSV. It makes the following assumptions:

-   Each row represents a character
    
-   Each column represents a character trait
    
-   The first row of the CSV is assumed to be column headers representing field names
    

If you’d like complete control over the import, you can complete this CSV template manually:

[https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-characters-import-template.csv](https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-characters-import-template.csv)

### Exporting Your Characters

While your Story Bible is not included during a typical project export, the Characters section of Story Bible has its own Export feature available, allowing you to download the entirety of the Characters section. That file will include all of your Characters, and all of their traits. Here’s how to use it.

**Characters Export:**

-   Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
    
-   You’ll be presented an Export option
    
-   Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns

### Genre

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 7291201-genre
**ID:** 7291201
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:13:48.622Z

## Genre

This is where you specify the genre of the story you’re writing, which affects the tropes, tone, and style of the outlines and prose that’s generated by Sudowrite. Rather than jotting down a literal genre, we recommend you unpack some of the themes and thematic elements you’re looking for in your story.

✏️ **Examples**

-   _Space opera, science fiction_
    
-   _Historical Romance_
    
-   _Literary Realism_
    
-   _Alt history timeloop_ </aside>
    

✨ **Pro-tip!** Is the AI writing romance that’s a little _tired_? Change it to _friends to lovers romance_, or _small town cozy romance_, or avoid the term _romance_ altogether. In general, you’ll get the best (least tropey) results if you can unpack the thematic elements you’re actually looking for.

Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

### Outline

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 1761456-outline
**ID:** 1761456
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:27:58.902Z

### The Outline is where you tell Story Bible about the structure of your story.

You can have Story Bible generate an Outline for you based on your Synopsis, Genre, and Characters, or you can import or write your own Outline from scratch.

♾️ **The Outline section of Story Bible has no word limit.** It can include as many chapters as you like, and each one can be as long as you like. (Though a good editor might suggest otherwise.)

### Generate Outline

There are two ways to approach creating your Story Bible’s Outline: generating it all at once, or chapter-by-chapter.

**To tell Story Bible to create a complete Outline, just click the Generate Outline button.**

💡Outline generation is influenced by Genre, Synopsis, Characters, and Worldbuilding. Meanwhile, your Outline will directly inform Beat generation.

Alternatively, you can click the **\+ Add Chapter** button to add a single chapter to your outline at a time. Once you’ve done so, you can fill that chapter summary in manually or using the **Generate** button. If you choose Generate you’ll be presented with a **Custom Instructions** box, where you can optionally tell Sudowrite how you’d like that chapter to go. If you opt not to give any specific instructions, it will do its best based on the context available.

### Editing Your Generated Outline

If the Outline that Sudowrite generated for you doesn’t match your vision, you can fix it by adding your notes to the **Rewrite Outline** box—this is field is revealed only when clicking Rewrite under the **More menu (•••)** in the Outline section header. Click **Go** and Sudowrite will take another pass, rewriting the entire outline while incorporating your feedback. (You can get pretty specific with your feedback here!)

Meanwhile, if a specific chapter in your generated outline is almost there but still needs work, you can Rewrite a chapter by clicking into the text field containing the summary and selecting **Rewrite**. Just as with the full outline rewrite, you’ll be able to give specific instructions as to what needs to change (ex. “End in a cliffhanger”).

The **More menu (•••)** also includes the **Delete** option, in case you ever need to start over entirely.

Once you have a generated outline that you’re happy with, make sure the details match your vision for the story. Just as with every other section of the Story Bible, the more specific you are, the better yours results.

### Editing Your Outline

At any point in the Outlining process, you can also Add individual chapter summaries. This can be helpful if you want to insert a chapter after-the-fact or extend your Outline. Click the **\+ Add Chapter** button in the section header to create a new blank chapter summary field—then just drag it into place. Alternatively, you can just hover _between_ the chapters where you’d like to insert the new chapter summary and an + Add button will appear.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d1f04f5d5e47043fcfc/019be199-09ab-7bb3-a255-11e5d39065af/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=552398d136aaeef48019a202d6f3795b696fc986adab56dd0db0b29397c42a38)

Your chapters can be named anything you’d like—“Chapter 1, Epilogue, Scene” etc.

You’ll also notice that **Acts** are created when generating an Outline. You can create these from the **\+ Add Act** button in the Outline section header as well. Acts are like dividers that can be dragged to any point in the Outline to help you organize your outline and visualize the story at a high level. The can be named anything—“Part, Book, Episode, Section” etc.—whatever fits your work (and you don’t need them at all for the Outline to work).

You can delete Chapters or Acts using their respective More menu (•••). If you delete a chapter and want to get it back, you can do that through the Outline History menu (the little Clock icon) in the Outline section header’s More menu (•••).

### Drafting Your Chapters

When you’re ready to start writing a chapter, hover over a chapter summary and click the **Start Chapter** button (which appears as a plus document icon) next to that chapter’s More menu (•••). This will create a “linked document”—a document linked to this chapter summary in your Outline, which allows Write, Draft, and other features to know what to write. Any time you click a chapter summary’s More menu (•••) in your Outline, you’ll see a list of all the documents that have been linked to this chapter summary.

### Keeping Your Outline Updated

As you write your book, you’ll probably make changes to your chapters that stray from the original Outline you’d written or generated. You can easily update the linked chapter summary in your Outline with one click by selecting “Update” from the More menu (•••).

### Scenes & Chapter Prose

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 2475330-scenes-and-chapter-prose
**ID:** 2475330
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:42:46.519Z

### Generating Chapter Prose

When using Story Bible sequentially—that is, gradually developing your story from the ground up by completing those fields—the final step of the process will be generating chapter prose using the **Draft** tool. Draft is represented by the little typewriter icon in top right corner of your text editor in Sudowrite.

Draft looks at your Style, Genre, Characters, Worldbuilding, and **Scenes** to write a first draft of that chapter for you. But before you can get help from Sudowrite generating that chapter’s prose, you first need to either write or generate those Scenes.

### What are Scenes?

**Scenes** are the building blocks of chapters in Sudowrite’s Draft tool. They represent distinct moments in your story—each one typically encompassing a single location, timeframe, or character context. A chapter may have one scene, or several.

Scenes let you guide Sudowrite to write your chapter exactly the way you imagine it. Whether you're describing a heated conversation in a cabin, a chase through city streets, or a quiet reflection on a rooftop, each Scene is a self-contained unit of storytelling. This format should feel familiar and intuitive for anyone who has ever read a book or watched a movie—a scene is something happening to someone (or _someones_) somewhere—and it allows Sudowrite to generate focused prose that closely follows your structure and creative vision.

Think of Scenes as the natural atomic units of storytelling—aligned with how writers already plan and think about narrative flow.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d37b929a1bb6c0a2689/019be1a5-4efe-7d6d-ad55-bf186ee744b7/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=22c1f8a0282bbef1ed4480ca561bb819eaa12420b5b85d9381b92802662d1069)

### **How do I generate chapter prose from Scenes?**

Scenes are the precursor step to prose generation in Sudowrite. Here’s how they work step-by-step:

**1\. Write or Generate Scenes**

The top box of the Draft tool is labeled **Scenes**. This is where you list the key narrative moments you want your chapter to contain. Each Scene appears as a numbered item in a list, and may be as short or as long as you like. You can:

-   **Write your own** **Scenes** manually.
    
-   Or click **Generate Scenes** to have Sudowrite generate a list based on your linked Outline’s chapter summary.
    

Scenes utilize a feature called Story Bible Detection, which lets you know when something or someone mentioned in a Scene is recognized from your Story Bible. Detected Characters and Worldbuilding elements will appear underlined, whether you generated those Scenes or wrote them yourself.

💡**How to define chapter length in Draft**

There’s no way to specify how long you want your drafted chapter to be. Instead, the length of the chapter prose that Sudowrite generates is a function of how many Scenes you’ve included—more scenes means a longer chapter. If you want to reduce the length of the prose that Draft generates, just reduce the number of scenes—you can consolidate all of your scenes into a single numbered bullet and Sudowrite will still accurately generate.

**2\. Optionally add Extra Instructions**

The Draft box includes an **Extra Instructions** field below your Scenes. This is where you can optionally include specific notes that Sudowrite should consider when writing chapter, including:

-   Style or tone reinforcement (e.g., “dreamlike,” “sparse and fast-paced”)
    
-   Specific plot notes (e.g., “End on a cliffhanger”)
    

These instructions can reiterate other parts of your Story Bible, and help Sudowrite better match your unique storytelling voice and intent.

💡Sudowrite will generate chapter prose using the default model, Muse, unless you say otherwise. Click the dropdown arrow to the right of the Generate button to toggle between Prose Modes and AI models as desired. Make sure to do so before you click Generate!

**3\. Incorporate helpful feedback**

With those fields complete, you can click Generate to have Sudowrite automatically analyze your Scenes to make sure they’re clear and well-structured. If a Scene looks too short, too sprawling—such as covering too many events, characters, or locations—or something else, you’ll see a friendly suggestion with a proposed fix. You can:

-   **Accept** the Quick Fix (like splitting a Scene or clarifying it)
    
-   Or **ignore the suggestion** altogether and proceed with your current Scenes as-is
    

This first stage “check” also creates a word count and credit estimate, so you can know what to expect when you do proceed.

4.  **Generate your chapter**
    

Once you’re happy with your Scenes and the estimates provided, just click **Generate**. Sudowrite will write your chapter in prose, closely following your structure and tone.

Each Scene is transformed into part of a seamless, compelling chapter draft that should closely match your vision for the story. You can watch the prose magically appear in the document below—and you can always pause the generation if you notice the AI is taking one too many creative liberties.

Style affects the tone, word choice, and sentence structure that Sudowrite uses anywhere the Style is included. What you put here has the most significant style influence on Prose written with Draft or the Write button.

✏️ **Examples**

-   _Lush prose_
    
-   _Spare and haunting. Written in short sentences with lots of menacing dialogue._
    
-   _Whimsical and dense_
    
-   _Action-packed and violent_ </aside>
    

✨ **Pro-tip!** While not _necessary_, Sudowrite experts recommend tweaking both your Genre and Style boxes in advance of generating a particular chapter, so that you can really dial-in a specific tone. Style in particular has a big impact on prose.

Style is filled in manually—or by using the Match My Style feature—and is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Style directly influences both Beat and Chapter generation.

### Synopsis

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 0063553-synopsis
**ID:** 0063553
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:16:52.590Z

Synopsis establishes the characters, their goals, the central conflict, how your story begins and how it ends. It also conveys your story's tone, themes, and unique elements.

**To tell Story Bible to create your Synopsis, just click the Generate button.**

If your Braindump is missing crucial elements, Story Bible will have to get more creative in order to fill in the blanks in your Synopsis. So be sure to include anything of vital importance to your story in the Braindump!

### Improving your Synopsis

Once Story Bible has generated your Synopsis, you’ll likely want to make changes. These changes can be small, like changing a character name or setting, or big, like restructuring the entire ending. As with Braindump, it’s good to provide as much detail as you can in your Synopsis, because the AI will use this information later on in other sections.

There are two ways to make these changes:

1.  **Make changes manually.**
    

Do this by editing the text of your Synopsis directly in the text box.

1.  **Use AI to rewrite your Synopsis.**
    

When your cursor is in the Synopsis field, you’ll see a “Rewrite” button below the text. Click it to offer the AI some instructions on rewriting your Synopsis, the same way you might give a junior writer feedback.

Once you’ve typed the changes you want made, just click the **Go** button.

🕓 **QUICK TIP**

✏️ **Rewrite Examples**

-   _Add more tension in the beginning of the story_
    
-   _Make the antagonist more likable_
    
-   _Change the ending to be sad_ </aside>
    

The generation of Synopsis is informed by both Braindump and Genre. The Synopsis influences the generation of Characters, Worldbuilding, Outline, and Scenes. As mentioned previously, in the event the Synopsis field is empty, the fields that rely on Synopsis would instead defer to the Braindump.

# Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting

## Three Steps to Awesome Prose

1️⃣ **Make it your own**

Modify the outputs you get from Story Bible to make them your own and express your unique voice. You’ll probably spot a few things in each section that don’t track with your vision. Take every chance to express your own ideas and you’ll be surprised how much Story Bible will begin to channel your sensibilities!

2️⃣ **Keep it up to date**

As you progress through Story Bible, details about your story will likely change. For example, your characters may evolve, the setting might shift, or you might change the ending. Keeping all of the Story Bible sections up to date will make sure that Sudowrite doesn’t get confused as things change.

3️⃣ **You decide what’s important**

One of the creative choices you make in writing with Story Bible is deciding what information you emphasize to your junior writing partner. You might value Characters most and focus on characterization and arc. Or you might prioritize setting, or dialogue. Experiment with different emphases in your Scenes, Style, and elsewhere and see what works best for you.

## The Three Horsemen of Bad Prose

❌ **Vagueness**

Replace any vagueness with specific ideas. Otherwise, Story Bible will fill in the gaps—that's an opportunity for it to either delight or disappoint you; It won't always delight you!

Generate stronger prose through **specificity**.

❌ **Conflicting information**

If Sudowrite sees conflicting information or instructions across sections of your Story Bible or documents, it may get confused and write something that doesn’t make sense. To avoid this, **make sure all your sections are consistent and delete anything out of date.**

✏️ **Example**

Story Bible looks at prior sections to generate the current section. For example, Prose Generation looks at Style, Characters, and Scenes, so if you define a character as _”dreams to become a baker one day”_ but you have a Scene that says _”decides to quit being a baker”_, Story Bible might be confused.

Which is it? Does this character want to be a baker or not!?

To fix the inconsistency, update the character descriptions to reflect your character at the point of time in the story you’re currently writing.

In short, generate stronger prose through **consistency**.

❌ **Confusing wording**

Sometimes we write something down that’s obvious to _us_ but might be confusing to AI. When this happens, Story Bible might write something that is actually reasonable if you read carefully, but appears totally ridiculous on first blush. Try to **be precise in your wording and look for ambiguities** in each section to avoid this

✏️ **Example**

You have a Scene that includes:

_"Joey tries to tell Suzie that there’s nothing wrong, but Suzie knows what he did"._

To you this may be obvious. After all, in Chapter 2, Joey accidentally ran over the neighbor’s dog and buried it in the woods, but when drafting Prose, Story Bible only looks at Style, Characters, and Scenes, so it doesn’t know what happened in Chapter 2 unless you choose to link prior documents. In this case, Story Bible doesn’t know what _”what he did”_ refers to.

To fix this, you could be more precise and write:

_”Suzie knows that he killed and buried the neighbor’s dog secretly”_ as part of the Scene.

In short, generate stronger prose through **clarity**.

There’s almost always a rational explanation for any mistake Story Bible makes. As Sherlock Holmes says in _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”

Channel your inner Sherlock, and you’ll get back on track in no time.

### What is Story Bible

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 1671191-what-is-story-bible
**ID:** 1671191
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:10:50.385Z

Story Bible gathers the core elements of your story in one place so that you and Sudowrite’s AI can reference them as you develop your work. As a feature, it has two purposes:

1.  **Keeps you organized:** Story Bible gives you a way to develop your narrative, beginning with something as simple as a Braindump. If you step through it sequentially you’ll create all the core components of your story, including (eventually) Scenes and even Chapter Prose.
    
2.  **Keep the AI on track:** Story Bible works as a source of truth that both you and the AI can refer back to later. Even if you don’t want to use it to generate your story, it’s a great place to park anything you know for sure about your narrative.
    

Each project on Sudowrite has its own Story Bible, and it can be toggled on or off depending on just how you like to work.

# Overview

Working with Story Bible lets you build a long-form narrative from just the seed of an idea. You’ll be guided through the various stages of writing a novel, from synopsis to outline to fully-realized scenes.

Like any other Sudowrite tool, the resulting story is only as good as the writer directing it. Think of it like an improv act: pay attention to what Story Bible writes, then edit and respond with words that are true to your vision. In the end, you will have a first draft of scenes that you can develop further.

You’ll find your Story Bible in the left bar of your Project, beneath your document list.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6c7f628c454516ad35e2/019be187-fedb-725b-bb70-37bee4f3d785/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f7e010dedc030260713c6cd9680032498886bd95e915820510f82c6bac2363f1)

## How to move through Story Bible

Story Bible works a little differently from other parts of Sudowrite. Here are the basics:

-   When Story Bible is toggled on, the individual Story Bible fields will be displayed beneath the prose section of your document.
    
-   Story Bible is persistent—that means as you jump from document to document in your left Project management bar, the same Story Bible contents will remain visible _beneath_ the prose section. (Only the document’s body will be toggled.)
    
-   Click into a field for details and examples of how exactly a given section of the Story Bible works. This will reveal context on what it influences down the line in regards to generation.
    
-   Any section can be manually populated to any degree—but some sections also feature a **Generate** button. Click the **Generate** button and Story Bible will make a suggestion for that section. You can always revise or rewrite these generations to your liking.
    
-   As an alternative to manually editing the generation, whenever you see a **Rewrite** button in a field, you can use that to give Story Bible specific instructions on how you’d like _it_ to modify the generation you’d produced.
    

## How are the Story Bible fields connected?

A common question when it comes to Story Bible is: Which boxes or steps of Story Bible influence _other_ steps of the process. It’s a little complicated, but here’s an explanation. (Don’t worry, you won’t be quizzed on this, and you don’t need to remember it to get great results!)

**Braindump:**

This is the starting point of Story Bible, where you’ll capture your initial ideas for the story. It’s filled in manually, and since it can’t be generated it is not influenced by any of the other fields.

Braindump directly influences the generation of Synopsis. Otherwise, if the Synopsis is never filled in or generated, fields that are typically influenced by Synopsis will defer instead to the Braindump.

**Genre:**

Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields.

Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation in Draft.

**Style:**

Style is filled in manually—or by using the Match My Style feature—and is not informed by any other Story Bible fields.

Style directly influences both Beat and Prose Generation in Draft.

**Synopsis:**

The generation of Synopsis is informed by both Braindump and Genre.

The Synopsis influences the generation of Characters, Worldbuilding, Outline, and Scenes.

As mentioned previously, in the event the Synopsis field is empty, the fields that rely on Synopsis would instead defer to the Braindump.

**Characters:**

Characters are generated based on the Synopsis.

Meanwhile, Characters directly influences the generation of your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Draft.

**Worldbuilding:**

Worldbuilding is influenced by the Synopsis, when generating random Worldbuilding elements.

Meanwhile, Worldbuilding directly informs your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation in Draft.

**Outline:**

Outline is influenced by Genre, Synopsis, Characters, and Worldbuilding.

Meanwhile, Outline directly informs Scene generation.

**Scenes:**

Scene generation considers the most Story Bible context, taking into account Genre, Style, Synopsis, Outline, Characters, and Worldbuilding.

Scenes directly influence Prose Generation in Draft.

**Draft:**

When generating chapter prose, the Draft tool is informed by Style, Genre, Characters, Worldbuilding, and Scenes.

📌 **Note:** Scene and Prose Generation (in Draft) will only look at explicitly mentioned Characters and Worldbuilding elements.

### Worldbuilding

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 0051483-worldbuilding
**ID:** 0051483
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:32:29.161Z

## Worldbuilding

The Worldbuilding section of Story Bible is the place to create and store all of the important details of your world—everything from settings, to items, to lore, and beyond. These building blocks help you stay organized, while giving the AI helpful context on your story world. Sudowrite uses the relevant context from your Worldbuilding cards when writing for you.

🌐 _N.B._ Completing the Worldbuilding section is optional, and you don’t _need_ to add any Worldbuilding cards in order to use the Draft tool. That said, you’ll get better results from the AI if you give it the additional context of frequently-referenced elements—for example, describing a core setting.

> When generating Worldbuilding elements, the Worldbuilding section is influenced by the Synopsis. Meanwhile, Worldbuilding directly informs your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

The Worldbuilding section is very open-ended. It provides a wide range of templates. No matter what you select, your Worldbuilding entry will be tracked on a collapsible, customizable card.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d00b929a1bb6c09aaf5/019be19c-6ac0-7e03-b35c-a321bf878c72/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e0bd6de7b17109d8d4fac5f1665e6162f018333342380dd2dd193d112b4fd803)

### Worldbuilding Cards

**Each individual Worldbuilding entry gets a card of its own in the Worldbuilding section of your Story Bible.**

Cards are how you keep track of each entry, meaning that **a card may represent a clue, magic system, setting, or something else altogether**. You can select from the card templates available, or create an entirely custom entry using **\+ Custom** when creating a card (or in the trait customization).

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d00b929a1bb6c09aaf5/019be19c-c76e-7a8a-b1d5-bc96e0e5dc07/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f6e0b1613e93e0af790111ae1d000c7050b26205b3c44aaa038e57baba940c76)

As with Characters, Worldbuilding entry cards can be collapsed using the arrow next to the element name, and dragged to your preferred order with the six-dot handle in the upper left.

The dropdown next to the card Title allows you to toggle the Worldbuilding entry Type from the available options. You can see previous versions of that card in the card history—accessed from the clock icon up top—and you can delete a Worldbuilding card using the three dots on the right.

### Creating Worldbuilding Entries

You can create Worldbuilding entries with or without the AI’s help. If you click the purple **\+ Add Element** button, you’ll be able to select from **Blank Element**, **Generate Element**, or **Surprise Me**.

If you’d like to manually complete the card, just select Blank Element. Choose what type of Worldbuilding element you’re creating a card for, and then fill in the associated trait fields. Generate Element will let the AI do all the work—you just give a brief description of what it is you’re looking for and Sudowrite will get to work. This is a great option if you already have notes available, and you want the AI to structure and flesh out those notes. Surprise Me will instantly generate a random element that fits the vibe of your story, based on an analysis of the story you’re trying to tell and what you’ve already got documented.

### Worldbuilding Traits & Trait Customization

Each type of Worldbuilding element has a slightly different set of default traits for you (or the AI) to complete. For example, the **Clue** template includes a _Implications_ trait, whereas the **Item** template includes a _Who owns this item_ trait. These traits offer a helpful starting point, but you can add to or change them as desired.

Individual traits can be added at the card level—say for example if you have a specific setting that needs to include HOA details—by clicking **\+ Add Trait** at the bottom of that card. Title the trait, and fill it it as desired.

If you’d prefer to add something that should exist across all Setting cards you create, you’ll want to update the Default Traits for all Setting elements by clicking the **More menu (•••)** in the Worldbuilding section header and choosing **Customize Traits**. The process is the same for all the element templates—just select a different element from the drop down.

As with Characters, traits are there both for _your_ reference, _and_ that of the AI. **Traits inform how the AI will write about an entry when it is referenced (either directly, or using one of the defined “Other Names”).** This is good to keep in mind when you’re titling and populating traits. A general rule is that if a junior writer or copy editor could make sense of your traits, the AI should be able to handle it well.

### Generating Traits

After adding new default traits to pre-existing Character cards or Worldbuilding elements, you may wind up with a bunch of empty trait fields. Traits can always be filled in manually, but sometimes you want the AI’s help with that, so you have the ability to generate traits individually as well.

**When a trait field is empty, just put your cursor inside of the field and click _Generate_.** You’ll have the option to provide custom instructions, but you can also just click _Go_. The AI will then populate that trait field with something contextually appropriate. The AI takes the rest of your Worldbuilding elements, and Story Bible context into consideration when generating those traits individually. You also have the option to Rewrite trait fields that you’re not satisfied with. Just **click Rewrite from within the trait field**, provide custom instructions (if desired), and click Go. The AI looks at the current version of the trait, then rewrites it either according to provide instructions or (if blank) its own intuition and context.

## Story Smarts

### Chapter Continuity

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 8989228-chapter-continuity
**ID:** 8989228
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:49:15.764Z

**Chapter Continuity is a feature that allows you to sequence your documents**, telling Sudowrite which chapter came before which. By linking chapters together, you enable Sudowrite’s AI to treat those separate documents as one continuous story—allowing tools like **Write** and **Draft** to draw on prior context and create smoother transitions, clearer character arcs, and more consistent narratives throughout your work.

## What Chapter Continuity Does

When you define preceding documents in the document linking tool, those documents will be included as additional context for the AI when using certain AI features. Our AI tools—especially Write and Draft—work best when they can draw on previous events, tone, and story structure. Linking your documents ensures that context from earlier chapters helps shape what comes next.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6dcf04f5d5e47045c14e/019be1a8-64a5-7768-873d-c9fd39de4261/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=33d8b553d2f9c57a0c74a295d4e3b5e3c2d73d455f53f27c0c2bfbbbfc0d3955)

## How to Link Chapters

To create a link between two documents, click the **More menu (•••)** that appears next to the document title in your project’s text editor. The Document Linking Menu will appear with two questions:

-   Is this document in your Outline?
    
-   Does this document continue another one?
    

Linking the document to your Outline tells Sudowrite which chapter _this_ document is supposed to be. That context will be used by tools like Write, Draft, Quick Edit, and Chat. Meanwhile, you can select **Connect it** and choose the prior chapter from the dropdown that appears to tell Sudowrite which document precedes this one.

Once you’ve made these selections, the relationships are saved and will remain visible in the Document Linking Menu. You can change or remove this connection—by selecting Disconnect from the dropdown—at any time.

You can continue a document from any other document in your project, whether or not those documents are linked to your Story Bible’s Outline. That said, linking documents _and_ Outline chapter summaries will give Sudowrite even richer context.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6dcf04f5d5e47045c14e/019be1a8-bd66-7328-948b-03192b92374c/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=097402e16d35101903d340a4c923ba2803c55088818a98faf7f2db9e807e166e)

## Automatic Linking from the Outline

If you’re generating new chapters from your Outline, Sudowrite will automatically attempt to link them in sequence. For example, if you create Chapter 2 (from either the left bar’s **\+ New** menu or your Story Bible’s Outline) and there’s already a linked Chapter 1 in the project, Chapter 2 will be created with the Outline’s chapter summary linked and Chapter 1 set as the preceding document. If you skip creating some chapters in the middle—for example, you jump ahead to Chapter 5—Sudowrite will look back for the most recent connected chapter and link to that.

These automatic links are there for your convenience, but you can always change the selections or disconnect a document altogether. This is especially useful for stories with alternating points of view, nonlinear timelines, or other custom structures. It’s also helpful to know that creating a Blank document from the + New menu will create a document without this automatic linking—there will no linked Outline or preceding chapter by default (but you can still make those selections later, if desired).

## Chapter Continuity in Write

When you click the **Write** button in a document that’s linked to a previous one, Sudowrite pulls in up to **20,000 words** of text total from that linked document. If you have several documents connected in series, Write will look at up to **25 previous documents**, starting from the most recent and moving backward until it hits either the word or document limit.

🔗 **For example**, If I’m using the Write button in Chapter 5, and I’ve updated the “Continues from…” setting in each preceding document, the Write button will read Chapter 4, 3, 2, and 1 before it generates. If I had an epic 30,000 word Chapter 4 (for some reason) Write would only read back 20,000 words into Chapter 4.

Write also pulls in up to 20,000 words from the current document—again, starting at the end (or, the cursor position where you’re using the Write feature) and working backward.

This allows Write to stay grounded in the events, characters, and voice of your earlier chapters, with a bias towards the more recent/relevant developments when there’s too much context. Your Write card will include a set of **chiclets** that shows which documents were included, and how many words of each.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6dcf04f5d5e47045c14e/019be1aa-8418-713a-b8cf-25600d08bdb3/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b18c7b14eff638381c3865d2012484a2151c6e0195a4441348cb9c47b4351827)

## Chapter Continuity in Draft

The **Draft** tool also takes full advantage of Chapter Continuity, both when generating Scenes and when writing chapter prose. If your document is linked to a previous chapter, Draft will look backwards through up to 25 documents and incorporate up to 20,000 words of prior content, as with Write. This helps Draft maintain story cohesion, character arcs, and narrative consistency. It also helps the AI make more logical choices in places where it may not have sufficient guidance from you.

As with Write, the most recent documents in the established sequence will be prioritized. In projects with very large chapters or complex continuity chains, some scene-specific context may be crowded out—especially if the AI needs to make room for long chapters. You can always verify what was included in the chiclets of the Draft card created in your History column.

☝It’s possible for the AI to “max out” on the context you’re trying to show it. Rather than fail, in those cases the AI will proceed by excluding context in the following sequence.

Excluded in order from top to bottom

Worldbuilding

Characters

Previous Chapter Text

Linked Outline Summary

Genre

Key Details

Tone

Style

Preceding Text from the current document

Highlighted Text.

Write always includes as much as possible—partial inputs from these bits of context may still be passed to the AI when the full ones don’t fit.

## Chapter Continuity Best Practices

Use Chapter Continuity to keep your longform work coherent, but don’t feel constrained by it. Manual linking gives you full control and works well for flexible story structures. Automatic linking is helpful for straightforward chapter sequences based on your Outline, but it’s always editable.

If your Write or Draft results seem off—missing key characters or important events—check the chiclets to see what context was included. Trimming your current document or adjusting linked content can improve performance.

### Saliency Engine

**Slug:** 6295151-saliency-engine
**ID:** 6295151
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:38:58.552Z

## Saliency Engine

The first thing to know about Saliency Engine is that you won’t find a button or field for it anywhere in Sudowrite. **It’s running behind the scenes to help the AI stay focused on what’s relevant.**

You may have hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements in your Story Bible, but it’s rare that all of those will be relevant when you want to generate the prose for a specific beat. Saliency Engine reviews the task at hand, as well as all of the story information you’ve provided, in order to expose the most relevant information to the AI for prose generation purposes.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e2123b373be38049bd4/019be1a1-0f3c-7f76-8893-1db9644a8349/b64u-aW1hZ2UuZ2lm.gif?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=54c9ef274ca41a1ade8d7d3ce0e66542872fdcabd63905d7701a4f187d5060b6)

Saliency Engine will **make sense of mountains of story context** in an instant, keeping anything you generate on track. That means, for example, if your shifter is in wolf form, the AI _won't_ reference the pleated khakis they might typically wear to work.

### Which features does Saliency Engine work with?

Right now **Saliency Engine works in three places**: your Story Bible, the Write button (when your Story Bible is enabled), and Plugins. In each case, Saliency Engine will do a first pass to identify information relevant to the writing task at hand before passing those details on to the AI in order to generate text.

### Do I have any control over Saliency Engine?

Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just hover over the Character card and click on the eyeball icon that appears to toggle off the AI visibility.

**When the visibility of a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait is toggled off, Sudowrite’s AI will ignore it altogether.**

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e2123b373be38049bd4/019be1a1-a1fc-754d-a803-34a7c5f12215/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a97eb17cb41e3113332809598c7492fd9e00e12750111b8b7ca73328ade78786)

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine _may_ consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. To hide the Motive from Sudowrite, toggle the visibility setting within the Motive trait field from the eyeball icon in the upper right.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e2123b373be38049bd4/019be1a1-f8f0-76db-ba79-806c3b65a516/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7458e57228b6b82704cf3cb7c0ba3b85b76e63f6bd58c9cd17006740e81cb210)

Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and their traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.

⚠️Remember that hiding a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait from Sudowrite will hide it from all AI features. That means features like Chat, Write, and even Plugins will think it doesn’t exist (because they can’t see it).

### How Does Saliency Engine Work With Plugins?

Some plugins are designed to use your Story Bible data. In those cases, Saliency Engine may or may not be used, depending entirely on how the creator built that plugin.

-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters }}` or `{{ worldbuilding }}` variables, the Saliency Engine will kick in when necessary.
    
-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters_raw }}` or `{{ worldbuilding_raw }}` variables, the full context of those fields will be passed along into the AI in their entirety. The Saliency Engine will make no attempt to parse the data for relevant context.
    
    -   Note: In most cases, the `*_*raw` version will give the AI _way_ more context. This can either degrade or improve the results, depending on both the plugin configuration and the context passed through as a result… but it will almost always make the Plugin use more credits.
        
    -   **Hidden characters or traits will never be visible to the AI**, even if a Plugin is using the a `_raw` variable.
        

🚧 **Be Advised:** Credit cost is always calculated based on input, output, and the model selected. If a user with hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements uses a Plugin that includes the `_raw` version of a variable, a great deal of context will be passed through to the AI. **This could consume a ton of credits!**

All Plugins that predate the Saliency Engine use the standard `{{ characters }}` variable, and so will use Saliency Engine by default.

### Setting POV and Tense

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 4257043-setting-pov-and-tense
**ID:** 4257043
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T17:53:40.192Z

## **Point of View and Tense Settings**

Defining the Point of View and Tense of your story helps make sure that assistance from the AI is always on point. Sudowrite now has settings that provide explicit control over both the POV and Tense used by the AI while generating prose.

**The POV and Tense settings are located in Outline section of Story Bible.** They also appear in (and can be changed from) the Draft tool when opened.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/019be1ad-d6b0-7dbd-9363-4c2a226f9cc5/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=11d5859c35dd2aa05e57a3b1b8d55ec6a4b3d1835c56c3479333cb3c8b2ae483)

These settings tell the AI how it should write in the Draft tool, Write button (both Auto and Guided), and Expand, helping to ensure consistency in narrative voice and tense. You have the option of setting a global POV and Tense for your entire novel, or defining them on a per-chapter basis.

## **Default Settings**

When creating a **new project**, the POV and Tense is initially set to third-person limited, past tense. If you generate (or write!) a Synopsis in Story Bible, Sudowrite’s AI will intelligently choose the correct POV and Tense for your story. (For instance, a synopsis for a romance novel will likely prompt the AI to select either first-person or third-person limited POV and past tense since those are the POV and tense commonly used for romance novels.)

If you disagree with an AI-defined POV and Tense you can just change it. Once you’ve manually set a POV and Tense, it will remain what you set.

**Note:** Importing a file using Novel Import or directly into a project will set the POV and Tense settings to their defaults (3rd person limited, past tense).

☝You can change your POV and tense settings for a project at any time! (Sudowrite won’t attempt to guess your POV/tense once you’ve set one.)

## Point of View (POV) Options

**3rd Person Limited POV** (most common) - Stays close to only one character’s thoughts.

**3rd Person Objective POV** - Writes what a camera would see. No thoughts, just action.

**3rd Person Omniscient POV** - Reveals every character’s thoughts.

**1st Person POV** - Tells the story through the narrator’s eyes.

**2nd Person POV** - Makes “you” the main character.

## Tense Options

**Past Tense** - Creates a feeling of narrative storytelling, with a small distance between the reader and the characters.

**Present Tense** - Creates a more action-packed, dynamic tone. Commonly paired with first-person POV.

**Future Tense** - An unusual choice, useful when you want to create contrast, such as in a prophecy or fable.

## Character POV

If you want your story to be written in first person from your protagonist’s perspective, you can select that character from the Characters section of the POV dropdown menu. All named characters from the Characters section of your project’s Story Bible will automatically appear there.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/019be1ae-bbb7-7b64-9d00-ac108fea7d68/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=441c9534f3ffa80f5c9cd39a2c2202b1aef0178743161fcc6c9f4baed5f27a25)

You can actually assign more than one character to a chosen narrative perspective. When a single character is selected, the AI will write with _that_ character’s perspective in mind. If multiple characters are selected, the AI will use the context of the scene (Draft) or the highlighted or previous text (Write and Expand buttons) to determine the most appropriate character to use.

## POV & Tense Modes

You have two options when it comes to setting your POV and Tense.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/019be1ae-fa54-785b-a056-38b6c1b922aa/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=509d0f33339ece1daa2b90a2c8d04fb3c4ad496c046100a29a69b279f22701fd)

**Same for all chapters (Default):** A single POV and tense setting are applied to the entire novel, ensuring a consistent narrative voice throughout.

**Customize per chapter:** By choosing “Customize” in the _Apply to_ menu, you can customize the POV and tense for each chapter. This is ideal for stories with alternating perspectives or timelines. If you toggle back to “Same for all chapters,” the per-chapter settings are removed and the global settings are reapplied.

Choose your preferred mode in the **Outline section of the Story Bible.**

## **Draft Box Settings**

When you link a document to a chapter in your Outline (or create a linked chapter from it), the POV and Tense settings from the linked Outline’s chapter are automatically synced to the Draft box.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/019be1af-9763-799f-b3f1-e40d22d0abc9/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ff125c223940f3ea978fa671077b1c4985d8f3a2c09a3c1388183249f0bbe21a)

Any changes made to the POV or Tense within the Draft section will be automatically synchronized with the corresponding chapter's settings in the Outline, and vice versa. This ensures that your entire project remains consistent.

For a completely new and unlinked document within the Draft section, the system defaults to a third-person limited POV and past tense.

## **Where POV and Tense Works**

The settings you choose for POV and Tense tell the AI how to generate prose in the Draft tool. They also influence the Write button’s Auto and Guided modes, and Expand.

**Note:** Plugins can’t currently see these new POV and Tense settings. If you currently use Plugins that rely on a POV and Tense in your Style box, it may be preferable to keep the redundant instruction in your Style box for now. Just be sure they’re consistent with what you’ve set in the selector.

### Sudowrite Muse

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 6183030-sudowrite-muse
**ID:** 6183030
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:45:39.096Z

# What sets Muse apart?

1.  Basic AI writes boring emails. **Muse is just for fiction.** Focusing Muse entirely on fiction allows it to reach a higher level of quality compared to models which are meant to do it everything.
    
2.  Basic AI spews clichés. **Muse writes unique prose every single time.** We specifically measure AI clichés during training and have systematically removed them from Muse’s output.
    
3.  Basic AI loves happy endings. **Muse will write anything – no filters.** Muse is the most unfiltered model on Sudowrite, and embraces the full range of human experience, including violence, and adult themes.
    

You can learn more on the [Muse Webpage](http://sudowrite.com/muse).

# How to use Muse

Muse is the default AI model in Draft and Write. It also powers Expand.

This is what the model selector window looks like. Click “Use Muse” to select it. You will notice that this is where the Creativity setting and Style Examples live.

### Here’s how to select Muse in Draft

Open the Draft tool in the text editor’s top toolbar and scroll to the bottom. Click on the dropdown arrow to the right of Generate, and select Muse from the Prose Mode selector that appears.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e3ee290301d501beb42/019be170-7838-71f5-974a-8743f04c5de8/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9986e1a016b89f098c4f587a772324678f460f4341569c44babd8238d892277b)

### Here’s how to select Muse in Write

Click the dropdown arrow next to the Write button in your toolbar and select Write Settings from the list that appears. In your Write Settings, select Prose Mode and choose Muse from the available options.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e3ee290301d501beb42/019be171-08f0-7bbb-907c-6b17c60a93a6/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=33841896ba471e9cb2390d16fa21cef8009d5a35ff0ff3ff75c23aea75206054)

## Creativity

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e3ee290301d501beb42/019be171-884e-7f61-9c99-d1203c0d1eab/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=71719ed1ad48e64c1ab99f4eba7d54b034008503064a1334006d8ffff787401c)

Sudowrite Muse is different from other Prose Modes and models in that it also has a Creativity setting in the **Draft** tool\*\*.\*\*

-   Use more creativity if you want creative wording, and are willing to let the AI be creative with how the scenes unfold.
    
-   Use less creativity if you know exactly what you want to happen and don’t want the AI to take creative liberties.
    
-   Creativity has a special setting - _11._ This mode works quite differently from the rest
    

Creativity is document-by-document, in case different chapter different settings for best results.

## Style Examples

Style Examples are an optional tool in **Draft**—exclusive to Muse and Excellent—that makes Muse write more like you. You can enter up to 1,000 words of examples.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e3ee290301d501beb42/019be171-de78-7cf8-9d34-369ddfd03567/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=399a086ed93a02a03dcba0f51b41daa6e1378db3cf7ebedd093ada80fe0fa593)

For best results, if you include multiple samples from different sources, format them like this:

> Example 1: “lorem ipsum”
> 
> Example 2: “lorem ipsum”
> 
> Example 3: “lorem ipsum”

This helps clarify that these examples are not a continuous passage. Style Examples are consistent across your whole account (in other words, across documents and projects).

### Additional Details About Muse

Muse is available in Draft, Write, and Expand. It also powers Synopsis generation in the Story Bible.

Muse is an unfiltered model and works best in English for now. It may generate in other languages, but it may need additional prompting to do so reliably.

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine _may_ consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. To hide the Motive from Sudowrite, toggle the visibility setting within the Motive trait field from the eyeball icon in the upper right.

Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and their traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.

> Remember that hiding a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait from Sudowrite will hide it from all AI features. That means features like Chat, Write, and even Plugins will think it doesn’t exist (because they can’t see it).

### How does Saliency Engine work with Plugins?

Some plugins are designed to use your Story Bible data. In those cases, Saliency Engine may or may not be used, depending entirely on how the creator built that plugin.

    -   Note: In most cases, the `raw` version will give the AI _way_ more context. This can either degrade or improve the results, depending on both the plugin configuration and the context passed through as a result… but it will almost always make the Plugin use more credits.
        
    -   **Hidden characters or traits will never be visible to the AI**, even if a Plugin is using the a `raw` variable.

If a user with hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements uses a Plugin that includes the `raw` version of a variable, a great deal of context will be passed through to the AI. **This could consume a ton of credits!**

All Plugins that predate the Saliency Engine use the standard `{{ characters }}` variable, and so will use Saliency Engine by default.

# Prose Modes and AI Models

Authors can use Sudowrite without ever changing the default settings, but it's still helpful to know that Sudowrite does offer a variety of Prose Modes and AI models to suit different purposes.

Prose Modes are AI model suites specific to Sudowrite, designed specifically for fiction writing. These modes let you experience different output styles at varying costs, each offering unique balances of creativity, control, content filtering, and credit usage. We'll dive in below on the Prose Modes and AI models available on Sudowrite.

## Muse — Sudowrite's Fiction Model

Muse is Sudowrite's flagship proprietary model, purpose-built just for fiction. It was trained by writers for writers, unlike general AI models that try to "do everything." This focus allows Muse to achieve a higher level of story quality and nuance.

**Prose Quality & Style:** Muse delivers vivid, original prose with a strong creative voice, free from common AI clichés. Excels at rich descriptions, emotional beats, and maintaining consistent tone throughout your story.

**Instruction Following:** Prioritizes creative interpretation over strict obedience. Continues your story in imaginative ways while still incorporating Story Bible context and outline scenes effectively for narrative continuity.

**Content Filter Level:** Virtually none. Handles any content from dark and gritty to light and humorous, including graphic or mature themes that other AIs might refuse. Use discretion, but know Muse won't shy away from adult content.

**Credit Usage:** Higher credit cost than Basic mode (comparable to former "Premium" setting). Many authors find the quality worth the expense, though consider switching to cheaper models for brainstorming or extremely long outputs.

**Best Use Cases:** Ideal for high-quality fiction prose, especially creative, character-driven writing. Excels in impactful scenes, character interactions, and climactic moments. Perfect for unfiltered content including mature themes. Outputs often require less editing than other models.

**Weaknesses:** Not optimized for non-fiction or highly structured tasks. Definitely voice-y, and perhaps not to everyone's taste. May occasionally produce unexpectedly edgy content. Available exclusively within Sudowrite's ecosystem.

## Excellent — Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Excellent utilizes Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model as its primary engine. This mode is named "Excellent" because it aims for an excellent balance between creative prose and obedience to your instructions.

**Prose Quality:** Produces well-structured, descriptive writing with a flair for action and character movement. While not as stylistically unique as Muse, delivers engaging narrative that typically needs minimal polishing.

**Instruction Following:** Excellent's standout feature. Claude follows complex instructions precisely while maintaining context. Adheres closely to outlines and scenes while still expanding them creatively. Reliable for both storytelling and non-prose tasks like summarizing or brainstorming.

**Content Filter Level:** Moderate. More permissive than OpenAI models regarding violence and mild adult content, but has boundaries. May imply rather than explicitly describe adult situations or graphic content. Handles typical novel scenes well but might gloss over extremely explicit content.

**Credit Usage:** Mid-tier cost—more expensive than Basic but cheaper than Muse. Efficiently provides substantial output without rapidly depleting credits, making it ideal for budget-conscious writers who still want quality.

**Best Use Cases:** Perfect for general drafting and rewriting with balanced creativity and reliability. Excels with dialogue-heavy scenes, structured narratives, and when following outlines closely. Ideal for co-writing projects where story beats and world-building details must be respected. Works well for instruction-heavy tasks in plugins.

**Weaknesses:** Prose can feel less distinctive than Muse, sometimes "safer" or generic with minimal guidance. May faithfully reproduce errors in your outline or scenes. Might not deliver the intensity needed for certain scenes in your first attempt, due to its caution with mature content.

## Basic — GPT-4o Mini Model

Basic uses the lightweight and economical GPT-4o Mini as its backbone. This mode is all about speed and efficiency, giving you decent writing while stretching your credit budget. Don't let the name "Basic" mislead you – it's quite powerful, just tuned for cost-effectiveness.

**Prose Quality:** Delivers coherent, straightforward content that serves as solid first-draft material. Provides clear descriptions without poetic flourishes (e.g., "small and dimly lit room" vs. "bathed in faint flickering light"). Still remarkably competent for its size—better than older GPT-3.5 models with fewer errors, if less original.

**Instruction Following:** Highly obedient and literal, following scenes and instructions closely. Stays on track without introducing unexpected plot elements. Limited "story sense" compared to larger models—won't infer beyond what's explicitly prompted, which can lead to generic output if guidance is minimal.

**Content Filter Level:** Strict, inheriting OpenAI's content moderation. Avoids explicit sexual content and extreme violence, often skipping or neutralizing such elements. Adequate for mainstream fiction but may refuse or severely water down mature content in erotica or intense horror.

**Credit Usage:** Exceptionally credit-efficient—Basic's standout feature. Generates substantial text at minimal cost, making it ideal for limited budgets or massive projects. Perfect for exploratory writing, generating multiple scene versions, or any high-volume text needs.

**Best Use Cases:** Excels at speed-writing, brainstorming, quick drafting, and plot development. Ideal for connective scenes, experimentation, and utility tasks (summarizing, listing ideas). A dependable workhorse for getting words on the page efficiently.

**Weaknesses:** Lacks sophisticated elements like metaphors or emotional subtext. Complex or character-rich scenes may feel flat. May fall back on clichés or tropes. Best used for basics with plans to enhance later.

# Experimental AI Models

Sudowrite's Experimental selector offers AI models beyond the main Prose Modes. These provide granular control for specific chapters or specialized plugin tasks. Keep in mind these models haven't been extensively optimized for Sudowrite's specific fiction-writing workflows, but you may find their unique voices and capabilities suit your needs.

## Anthropic Models — Claude Family

Anthropic's Claude models are known for knowledgeable, thoughtful writing with large context windows, making them excellent for novelists who feed substantial story context. The Claude family on Sudowrite now spans multiple generations.

### Claude 4.x Series (Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Claude 4 Opus, Claude 4.1 Opus, Claude 4.5 Opus, Claude 4.5 Haiku)

The Claude 4 generation introduced hybrid reasoning capabilities, allowing models to switch between fast responses and extended thinking modes.

**Prose Quality:** Claude 4 models produce polished, coherent prose with strong narrative flow. Sonnet 4.5 in particular is praised for following instructions precisely while maintaining creative flair—it picks up on your writing style and keeps quirks intact rather than smoothing everything into generic prose. Opus variants offer richer detail and deeper world-feel, though at higher cost.

**Instruction Following:** Exceptional across the Claude 4 family. These models excel at adhering to complex outlines, maintaining character consistency, and respecting story constraints. Sonnet 4.5 rewards specific prompting—give it clear examples and direction, and it will match your voice closely.

**Content Filter Level:** Moderate. More permissive than OpenAI models but maintains boundaries. Claude 4 models handle typical novel content well, including violence and mature themes, though they may soften extremely explicit scenes.

**Credit Usage:** Varies by tier. Haiku 4.5 is the most economical option for everyday tasks. Sonnet 4.5 offers strong value as the balanced workhorse. Opus variants (4, 4.1, 4.5) are premium-priced—reserve them for complex scenes requiring maximum intelligence and nuance.

**Best Use Cases:**

-   **Sonnet 4.5:** General drafting, style mimicry, dialogue-heavy scenes, long-form content generation
    
-   **Opus variants:** Complex multi-character scenes, intricate plotting, final polishing passes, scenes requiring deep reasoning
    
-   **Haiku 4.5:** Rapid iteration, transitional scenes, brainstorming, cost-conscious bulk generation
    

**Weaknesses:** Can occasionally be wordy—Sonnet 4.5 sometimes doubles word counts during rewrites. Watch for AI-isms like em-dash overuse. Opus variants are slow and expensive, best reserved for critical work.

### Claude 3.x Series (Claude 3.0 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3.7 Sonnet)

The previous Claude generation remains available and still performs admirably for many tasks. Claude 3.7 Sonnet powers the Excellent Prose Mode and offers a proven balance of quality and economy. The Haiku variants are fast and affordable options for quick drafts or iterative work.

## OpenAI Models — GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5 Suites

OpenAI's model families offer different balances of capability, speed, and cost. These models are known for factual accuracy, logical coherence, and strong instruction-following.

### GPT-5 Suite (Full, Mini, Nano)

OpenAI's 2025 flagship family represents their most advanced offering.

**Prose Quality:** GPT-5 Full excels at generating high-quality dialogue and mimicking your writing style—authors report it's particularly strong at matching fragmented, punchy voices. However, it tends toward dialogue-heavy output with less descriptive prose, which can be an asset or limitation depending on your style. Produces imaginative, detailed prose for storytelling and world-building.

**Instruction Following:** Strong, with improved ability to maintain narrative consistency across long passages. GPT-5's massive context window supports extended narratives without losing track of earlier details. The model benefits from clear, specific prompting.

**Content Filter Level:** Strict. Inherits OpenAI's content policies, though somewhat relaxed within Sudowrite. May avoid or soften explicit content.

**Credit Usage:**

-   **GPT-5 Full:** Premium cost, best for important scenes and final drafts
    
-   **GPT-5 Mini:** Mid-tier, solid for general work
    
-   **GPT-5 Nano:** Budget option, though notably weaker for prose—optimized more for agentic/tool tasks than creative writing
    

**Best Use Cases:**

-   **Full:** Dialogue-heavy scenes, style mimicry, world-building, complex plot development
    
-   **Mini:** General drafting when budget matters
    
-   **Nano:** Utility tasks outside of prose generation (summarizing, quick edits)
    

**Weaknesses:** GPT-5 can try to "take over" stories rather than collaboratively continue them—it sometimes veers off-plot toward its own conclusions. Nano performs poorly for actual prose writing. The model may feel "clean" but lacks the raw creative spark some authors prefer.

### GPT-4.1 Suite (Full, Mini, Nano)

A strong mid-tier option with excellent instruction-following and a massive one-million-token context window.

**Prose Quality:** Produces precise, grammatically polished text. GPT-4.1 follows intricate instructions well from the first draft, making it valuable for authors who need tight adherence to complex plot details. Tone can feel somewhat formal.

**Instruction Following:** Standout capability. Superior at following complex, multi-part instructions and maintaining story continuity across very long narratives.

**Credit Usage:**

-   **Full:** Good value, often outperforming older premium models at lower cost
    
-   **Mini:** Roughly twice GPT-4o Mini cost with notably improved instruction-following
    
-   **Nano:** Extremely economical—approximately 30% cheaper than GPT-4o Mini
    

**Best Use Cases:** Detailed long-form writing, maintaining continuity in series, scenes requiring precise adherence to outlines.

**Weaknesses:** Prose can feel "academic" without stylistic guidance. Responds well to tone direction, so provide clear examples.

### GPT-4o Suite (Full, Mini)

The established workhorse of the OpenAI lineup.

**Prose Quality:** Versatile, producing vivid sensory-rich descriptions and detailed settings. Particularly strong for structured tasks and maintaining consistency. GPT-4o Mini delivers impressive quality at low cost.

**Best Use Cases:** General drafting, plugins, scenes requiring precision, consistency checks.

## Google Models — Gemini Family

Google's Gemini models have emerged as strong contenders, particularly excelling at long-context understanding and deep reasoning.

### Gemini 3 (Pro, Flash)

Google's latest generation, released November 2025.

**Prose Quality:** Gemini 3 Pro produces smart, concise, direct responses—less prone to AI clichés and flattery than predecessors. Prose feels cleaner and more measured. Flash prioritizes speed while maintaining reasonable quality.

**Instruction Following:** Strong reasoning capabilities. Gemini 3 Pro handles complex problems with depth and nuance, grasping context and intent with less prompting needed. Flash is more straightforward but reliable.

**Content Filter Level:** Variable. Generally cautious with mature content, though users report it's less preachy than some alternatives.

**Credit Usage:**

-   **Flash:** Extremely credit-efficient with 1M-token context window—ideal for plugins that scan entire manuscripts
    
-   **Pro:** Higher cost, reserved for complex reasoning tasks
    

**Best Use Cases:**

-   **Flash:** High-speed drafting, manuscript analysis via plugins, brainstorming, cost-conscious bulk work
    
-   **Pro:** Complex narrative problems, world-building requiring logical consistency, deep analysis
    

**Weaknesses:** Creative writing can feel "safe" compared to models specifically tuned for fiction. Better for scaffolding than polished final prose.

### Gemini 2.5 (Pro, Flash Thinking)

Previous generation, still available and praised for creative writing. Gemini 2.5 Pro developed a following for its handling of nuanced creative tasks and emotional depth. Flash Thinking adds deliberate reasoning for complex tasks.

## DeepSeek Models — Open-Source Alternatives

DeepSeek offers cost-effective alternatives with strong reasoning capabilities, appealing for budget-conscious authors or high-volume work.

### DeepSeek V3 / V3.1

**Prose Quality:** Competent, "serviceable" prose with solid grammar and basic creativity. Functions as a stylistic blank canvas you can shape. V3.1 represents iterative improvements over V3.

**Credit Usage:** Among Sudowrite's most credit-efficient options—even cheaper than GPT-4o Mini.

**Best Use Cases:** Quick brainstorming, rough drafts on tight budgets, generating large volumes of content for later enhancement. Output may need polishing but Quick Edit handles most issues.

**Weaknesses:** Occasionally awkward phrasing. Lacks sophisticated stylistic elements.

### DeepSeek R1

**Prose Quality:** Specializes in reasoning power with an internal "thinking" phase before writing. Produces coherent, logically consistent output.

**Best Use Cases:** Complex narrative problems, convoluted plots, mysteries requiring many clues to track, maintaining character consistency across intricate scenarios.

**Weaknesses:** The reasoning focus doesn't always translate to beautiful prose—strong on logic, less so on lyrical quality.

## Other Models

### Grok 4

xAI's model offers unique personality and strong emotional intelligence.

**Prose Quality:** Grok 4 can feel surprisingly human and empathetic in conversation. Strong at brainstorming, world-building, and maintaining logical consistency across complex scenarios. However, base prose generation tends toward the literal and robotic—several users describe it as "terrible at creative writing" without careful prompting.

**Instruction Following:** Good for structured tasks. Benefits from prompting that frames creative tasks as system-building rather than pure storytelling.

**Content Filter Level:** More permissive, with a "rebellious" personality that can generate unexpected ideas.

**Best Use Cases:** Pre-writing tasks (outlining, character development, world-building), research assistance for historical fiction, brainstorming unconventional ideas. Better as a planning partner than a prose generator.

**Weaknesses:** Prose is often flat and literal. May produce unintentionally humorous results when instructions are taken too literally. Use other models for actual scene writing.

### Kimi K2

Moonshot AI's model features massive scale (1 trillion parameters) with strong reasoning and extended context capabilities.

**Prose Quality:** Mixed reports. Kimi K2 topped benchmarks for creative writing and emotional intelligence, producing prose some describe as "high-literary" and character-bound. However, others find it weaker for actual fiction prose over longer passages—excellent at reasoning doesn't always mean excellent at beautiful sentences.

**Instruction Following:** Strong long-context memory. Can process enormous documents without forgetting earlier details.

**Content Filter Level:** Variable—API and web interfaces may behave differently.

**Best Use Cases:** Complex plot tracking, manuscript analysis, scenarios requiring extensive context retention, experimental work. May excel at generating thought-provoking literary work with thematic depth.

**Weaknesses:** Can "overthink" on simple tasks. Some users find prose quality inconsistent, particularly over 3,000+ words. Better for reasoning-heavy work than pure prose generation.

### Mistral Large 2

Open-source model offering enterprise-grade capabilities with high instruction obedience.

**Prose Quality:** Clear, well-structured prose that follows constraints precisely. Excels at argumentative essays, explainers, and technical writing. Creative fiction can feel procedural and "safe"—less inventive than models tuned specifically for storytelling.

**Instruction Following:** Exceptional. Among the most obedient models for executing precise, constraint-based outputs.

**Best Use Cases:** Structured content, technical writing within fiction (in-world documents, etc.), SEO-style content, tasks requiring tight format control. Works well for first drafts that you'll polish with a more creative model.

**Weaknesses:** Fiction prose lacks emotional nuance. Not the best choice for lyrical or character-driven scenes. Consider pairing with Claude for creative passes.

* * *

## Final Thoughts

Choosing the right AI model in Sudowrite significantly impacts your writing experience. For most fiction writers, start with the main Prose Modes:

-   **Muse:** For premium creative prose with a distinctive voice
    
-   **Excellent:** For balanced, reliable output that follows instructions precisely
    
-   **Basic:** For fast, economical drafting when quantity matters
    

As you grow comfortable with the platform, explore Experimental models for specific needs:

-   Speed vs. style
    
-   Creativity vs. precision
    
-   Unfiltered imagination vs. guided structure
    

By understanding each model's strengths and limitations, you can transform Sudowrite into a personalized writing partner that adapts to different phases of your creative process. Happy writing!

### Collaboration Options

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows

**ID:** 7364030
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:54:26.867Z

Whether you're working with a collaborator, an editor, or you just want to share your work, Sudowrite offers powerful collaboration features to help you get feedback on your writing. You can effortlessly create and share links to your work and even collect comments from readers, all while maintaining control over the sharing process.

## Document Sharing

Share your writing directly from Sudowrite with beta readers and collaborators. Whether it's a single chapter or a complete manuscript, you can generate shareable links that present your work beautifully.

To share a document:

1.  Click the **Share** icon in the upper right corner of your screen (next to the ⚙️ settings gear).
    
2.  Click the Share button to generate a link for your current document
    
3.  Alternatively, use the dropdown arrow beside the Share button to share a different document from your project
    

The link will be automatically copied to your clipboard, and you can always click the Copy button to grab that URL again. Anyone with that link can view your document. Meanwhile, you can click on the project in that Share menu to open the version of your document published to the web.

A few things to know about document sharing:

-   You can track all of your project’s shared documents in the Share menu
    
-   Unpublish shared documents anytime from that Share menu using the **More menu (•••)**
    
-   Changes you make to your document in the editor are automatically reflected in the shared version (though readers may need to refresh)
    
-   You can share multiple versions of your story by duplicating your document and generating different share links </aside>
    

## Clean Copy and Comments

Clean Copy is a feature of Sudowrite’s document sharing functionality that transforms how you collect and manage reader feedback. Share your document, distribute the URL, and each reader gets their own clean copy to comment on if they wish—keeping feedback both organized and private.

Here's how Clean Copy works:

-   Each reader can comment on the document you’ve shared with them by highlighting a passage and leaving their comment in the box that appears.
    
-   If they’re logged into Sudowrite, their display name will appear automatically. If they’re not, they can either log in, set a display name (only necessary once on the first comment they leave), or remain anonymous.
    
-   Readers never see one another’s comments—keeping your feedback unbiased. They will however see any responses that you, as the author, make to their comment.
    
-   Comments will appear along your document's right side. And of course, you can also now comment on your own document from the selection menu, which is super handy for revision workflows and situations where you'd just like to leave yourself notes. If you want to hide comments, just click the comment icon in the document toolbar to toggle them on/off.
    
-   With Comment Mode enabled, you will see all comments you’ve received along the right side of your document.
    
-   As the author, you can also leave yourself comments! No need to do so on a shared document either—you’ll see a **New Comment** option in the selection menu when you highlight a passage in your editor.
    

## Best Practices for Collaboration

-   Unpublish old shared versions when you want to direct readers to newer drafts
    
-   Use your own comments to track revision ideas while reviewing reader feedback
    
-   Share different drafts with different groups of readers by creating multiple share links
    
-   Check that readers are viewing the latest version by having them refresh occasionally
    

Clean Copy and document sharing make it easy to maintain a smooth feedback process with your readers while keeping your work organized within Sudowrite.

## Export Project as One Document

We added the ability to export your entire project as a single document rather than a .zip file of every document.

Now when you click the **More menu (•••)** on your project, you have the option to export all of that project’s documents _either_ as a bundled .zip _or_ as one merged document.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6c07628c454516abf706/019be176-fa87-7f21-919e-9843287dc3c7/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=454290e2c4780c1aa5c7965b97df2a0904d2280de54c0dfaf0b652dbfcdeaaea)

If you choose **Export as 1 doc**, the resulting .docx file will include all of your documents in the order that they appear in your project’s left bar (from top to bottom). Documents inside of folders and subfolders are included too, following that sequence. As with the .zip-based export, your Story Bible is not included in the resulting file.

## Document Export

Sometimes you only need to export a specific chapter or single document from your project. The Document Export option allows you to do just that, giving you flexibility in sharing or backing up individual pieces of your work.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6c07628c454516abf706/019be177-526d-7797-ba77-ab46f4fb4d6e/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a32f18f7809187880df10ab3952c0fcbfd0c6dd4088d785eda92c59c55e05dea)

**Document Export Purpose:** Export a single document or chapter from your project.

**How to use:**

1.  Open the desired project in Sudowrite.
    
2.  Select the document you want to export in the left sidebar.
    
3.  Click the three dot (•••) menu next to the document name.
    
4.  Select "Export (.docx)" from the dropdown menu.
    

**Features:**

-   Exports a single document as a .docx file
    
-   Generally preserves formatting and content of the selected document
    
-   Quick and easy way to share specific portions of your work
    

**Use cases:**

-   Sharing a single chapter with beta readers
    
-   Creating a standalone copy of a document for offline editing
    

🤲 Note that if you’re primarily looking to export a document in order to share it with a collaborator, you may be better served by using Sudowrite’s Document Sharing functionality. Details on Document Sharing, and the collaboration feature we call Clean Copy, are available here: [Collaboration Options](https://www.notion.so/Collaboration-Options-1a07975fa0ec8074a65dc02f25d4540e?pvs=21)

## Story Bible Export

Neither Project Export nor Document Export include your Story Bible contents by default. Some authors choose to copy and paste those fields into a document manually in order to export them, but three sections of the Story Bible each have their own Export functionalities.

**Outline Export:**

-   Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Outline section header of your Story Bible
    
-   You’ll be presented an Export option
    
-   Once Exported, you’ll receive a two-column .CSV file with your chapter names in the left column and corresponding chapter summaries in the right column
    

**Characters Export:**

-   Click the **More menu (•••)** option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
    
-   You’ll be presented an Export option
    
-   Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns

### Importing Files

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 5186529-importing-files
**ID:** 5186529
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:49:02.355Z

Sudowrite offers several different ways to import your existing work or works-in-progress. Each method serves a different purpose and has its own unique features. Let’s explore the available options to help you choose the best one for your needs.

## 1\. Import Novel

Do you have a work-in-progress that you’re excited to bring into Sudowrite to continue? Or perhaps you're gearing up to write a sequel and need a comprehensive Story Bible based on your previous work? The Import Novel feature is perfect for these scenarios. It's a one-stop solution that brings your entire manuscript into Sudowrite and fills in your Story Bible for you in the process.

**Import Novel Purpose:** Create an entirely new project with a pre-populated Story Bible based on your partial or complete manuscript (or even a less-than-organized pile of notes).

**How to use Import Novel:**

1.  Click the "Import" button in the upper left corner of your Sudowrite home page.
    
2.  Drag a file into the Import modal or click "Browse" to select a file from your computer.
    
3.  Wait for the import process to complete (typically a few minutes, but may take up to 10 minutes for complex manuscripts).
    

**Import Novel Features:**

-   Automatically creates a new Sudowrite project
    
-   Populates the Story Bible with the essential components, including characters, world-building elements, and a detailed outline
    
-   Optimized for documents up to 120,000 words
    
-   Focuses on importing 5-7 primary characters
    
-   Supports .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, and .odt file types
    

**Import Novel Limitations:**

-   Always creates a new project to avoid conflicts with existing Story Bible data
    
-   May generate placeholder names for unnamed characters
    
-   Very long outlines may be saved as separate documents (though we’re working on improving the Outline section of Story Bible to better support long outlines)
    

## 2\. Import Scrivener

You can now import your Scrivener projects directly into Sudowrite! Your documents and folder structure will be preserved, making it easy to pick up right where you left off.

Bringing in your work is simple:

1.  In Scrivener, go to File → Back Up → Back Up To… and save your project as a `.zip` file.
    
2.  In Sudowrite, click **Import Novel** from the homepage and select **Import Scrivener**.
    
3.  Select your `.zip` file and let Sudowrite do the rest.
    

Your entire project structure—folders, documents, and organization—will be recreated in Sudowrite, ready for you to start writing with all the powerful AI tools you know and love.

## 3\. Document Import

Sometimes all you need is to get your document into an existing Sudowrite project so you can get straight to work. Maybe you've written a few chapters already, or just want to use Sudowrite for the powerful editing tools. The simple Document Import is ideal for these situations, allowing you to bring in content without affecting your existing Story Bible or project structure.

**Document Import Purpose:** Add an existing document to your project without affecting the Story Bible.

**How to use:**

1.  In an existing project, click the "Import" button in the editor's left bar.
    
2.  Select the file you want to import.
    

**Features:**

-   Creates a single document in your project containing the full imported text
    
-   No limit on document size
    
-   Preserves any existing Story Bible content
    
-   Allows for manual Story Bible creation or editing after import
    

By choosing the appropriate import method, you can efficiently bring your existing work into Sudowrite while maintaining control over how it integrates with your project structure and Story Bible. Whether you're starting fresh with a completed manuscript, populating your character list, or simply adding content to an existing project, Sudowrite has an import option tailored to your needs.

## 4\. Outline Import

Already have a full or partial Outline for your book? The Outline section of Story Bible allows you to bring that Outline in—whether it’s formatted tidily or not.

**Outline Import Purpose:** Bring in a pre-existing Outline to your Story Bible.

**How to use Outline Import:**

1.  Navigate to the Outline section of your Story Bible.
    
2.  Click the three dots (•••) menu in the right corner of the header and select "Import Outline".
    
3.  Paste in your Outline or select a file. The default Outline Import will pull in what you provide as closely as possible, only making light changes required to fit Story Bible’s requirements.
    

**Outline Import Features:**

-   Accepts text input or file upload
    
-   Supports .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .odt, and .csv file types
    
-   Does not use credits
    

**CSV Import Option**

If you want to bring in your Outline _exactly_ as-is, and ensure the AI does not make any tweaks in the process, you can download the Outline CSV template and fill it out. Simply title Chapters as desired in the left column, and provide chapter details in the right. This rigid structure ensures that Sudowrite will take in your Outline without making any edits.

-   You can also get that template here: [Outline Import Template](https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-outline-template.csv)

### Organizing Your Projects

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 6639290-organizing-your-projects
**ID:** 6639290
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T16:47:58.662Z

Everyone has their own system when it comes to organizing their work, and now you can bring yours to Sudowrite. **Project** **Folders** can be used to track your project status, group your work by series or pen name, or just keep your desktop tidy.

You can create folders from the **\+ New** button in the upper lefthand corner, just like you would a new project. **Drag and drop** projects directly onto a folder to move them, or use the **Move to** option available in the **More (•••) menu**. A few things to know about folders:

-   Hover over any folder to **preview your 3 most recent projects** in that folder
    
-   **Click on a preview to go directly into that project** without opening the folder!
    
-   You can **create or move folders inside of folders**
    
-   Navigate easily with the **file path** provided at the top of your screen in folders
    
-   **Projects can be dragged over that file path** to relocate them
    

When you delete a folder, all its contents move to trash together. Don't worry—you can restore entire folders (and their contents) from the **Deleted projects** page, available via the Settings menu (⚙️) in the upper right, if you need them back.

🗂️ **Folders transcript**

While the visuals in the video above help illustrate the workflows outlined here, a transcript of the Folders video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Project folders are a new way to keep yourself focused and organized on Sudowrite. Here's how they work: First, click "New" in the upper left and select "Folder" to create a new folder. You can name that folder by selecting the name and typing - just hit return when you're done. Then you can move projects into that folder by just clicking and dragging. You'll be presented with a little preview of the projects that that folder contains. You can hover over the preview to flip through the projects, and you can even click straight into one of those projects from here without even opening the folder.

If there's a project that's a little bit far for clicking and dragging, you can use the three dots in the upper right and select "Move to" from the drop-down menu that appears. That will allow you to move it into any available folder. Folders can also contain other folders for even greater organization - just click "New" again inside of a folder to create a folder right there. Here I can drag something one layer deeper, and then inside of that folder, I have a file path appear up top so I know exactly where I am. If I want to move something back out to another folder, I could use "Move to," or I can actually just drag on top of that file path and it will move where I drop it.

If I'm done with a folder, I can delete it from the three-dot menu. In tidying up the homepage, we've also moved deleted projects, so those now live here in the settings gear. You can click into "Deleted Projects" to see both projects and folders that you've deleted, and you can also restore them from the three-dot menu.

That's it! We hope these changes help you create a more organized workspace that lets you get more done.

### Using the Sudowrite Mobile App

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 8875915-using-the-sudowrite-mobile-app
**ID:** 8875915
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20T23:30:00.000Z


# Using the Sudowrite Mobile App

> **Note:** This article has been split into multiple detailed articles. For comprehensive mobile app documentation, please see the **Sudowrite's Mobile App** section.

Sudowrite's iOS app is a companion app for iPhone that lets you work on your stories whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. Access your projects, write on the go, and even dictate new ideas with our mobile-exclusive feature: Smart Dictation.

## Getting Started

You can find the iOS app in the Apple App Store on your iPhone. The first time you launch the app, you’ll be prompted to log in. Be sure to use the same authentication method and details you use at sudowrite.com.

When you open the Sudowrite app, you’ll land on your **Projects screen**, which is a scrollable linear version of your homepage on sudowrite.com.

Your **Projects** appear as book icons, and **Folders** as—surprise!—folders. You can tap the **🔍 Search icon** (in the top right) to quickly find any project. Open the **Settings panel** by swiping in from the left edge of your screen, or tapping the **three bar (☰) icon** in the left of the bottom menu.

## Mobile Settings Panel

Inside the Settings panel, you can:

-   View your **account details** (including associated email address and remaining Credits).
    
-   Adjust your **editor settings**.
    
-   Access:
    
    -   **Your Rambles**, to review all dictated entries.
        
    -   **Help**, which links directly to our support documentation.
        
    -   **Feedback**, to tell us how we’re doing.
        
-   Sign out of your account.
    

## Navigating Projects

Tap on any project to dive in. The first thing you’ll see is the **Project Overview**, a list of **documents and folders** that looks just like the left document bar in a project on Sudowrite. You can tap on any document to read its title and contents, or you can click the **➕ Plus icon** in the right side of the bottom menu bar to **create**:

-   New documents
    
-   New folders
    
-   New rambles (more on that below!)
    

🛑**Heads up:** This iteration of the Sudowrite mobile app **does not include the AI features you’re used** to (like Write, Rewrite or Describe). It’s read and write only—for now, but some version of those are coming soon. The only AI feature in the app right now is Ramble.

## Story Bible Access

You can access (and edit) all of the information in your project’s Story Bible using the **📖 book icon** in the left middle of the bottom menu bar. You can:

-   Browse all your existing Story Bible fields, including **Characters** and **Worldbuilding** cards.
    
-   Note: **Custom worldbuilding types** are view-only and cannot be renamed on iOS (yet!).
    

You may make manual edits to your Story Bible here too, but you don’t currently have the same generation options you have on the web.

## Creating & Organizing Content

The options available to you under **➕ Plus** in the bottom menu bar depend on whether you’re at the home screen or inside of a Project’s Overview.

From the home screen, you may use the **➕ Plus icon to:**

-   **Refresh** your content if something you created on web hasn’t appeared yet.
    
-   Create a **New Project**.
    
-   Create a **New Folder**.
    
-   Create a **New Ramble**.
    

Meanwhile, from the **➕ Plus icon** inside of a project, you may:

-   Create a **New Document**.
    
-   Create a **New Folder**.
    
-   Create a **New Ramble**.
    

To **move a Project or Document** into or out of a folder, just press and hold on it—you’ll see a **Move** option appear.

## 🎙️ Introducing Rambles (iOS-only!)

Ramble lets you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page with nothing but your voice! Think of it as enriched, story-aware dictation—start a Ramble to share a story idea or concept, and Sudowrite’s AI will aim to shape that into a cohesive narrative. (Don’t worry, it will provide a transcript of your Ramble too!)

### Start a Ramble:

-   Tap the **🎤 microphone icon** in the center of the bottom menu **OR**
    
-   Swipe down from the top of the app (like refreshing a page) on the home screen or inside of a project.
    

Sudowrite will request mic access the very first time. Once you grant permission:

-   You’re live! Just talk—tell a story, monologue, world-build out loud. Dead air is totally fine, so feel free to think out loud as you go.
    
-   When you click the red stop button, Sudowrite will:
    
    -   Save your **verbatim transcript**.
        
    -   Create a cleaned up, **narrative version**—as if you’d written it yourself.
        

If you ramble **inside of a project**, the cleaned-up, narrative version **uses your Story Bible.** Since the AI has context on Characters and plot points from your Story Bible, those details will influence the arc of the narrative you’ve spoken about.

Rambling from the **homepage** (outside a project) works too—but no Story Bible magic there.

🗑️Started a ramble by accident? Tap the **trash can** to cancel.

Rambles are **exclusive to the app** and don’t appear on sudowrite.com.

## Syncing with the Web App

The app and [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com) should stay in sync automatically. However, if you don’t see a new document or folder you created on web:

1.  Tap the **➕ button** in the main screen’s menu bar.
    
2.  Choose **Refresh**.
    

This will re-sync your project view with the latest updates from sudowrite.com.

## Feature Summary

Here’s a quick overview of what you can expect in the app, and how it differs from sudowrite.com.

Feature

Available on iOS?

View & edit documents

✅

Create folders & docs

✅

Story Bible (read & write only)

📌**Sudowrite Mobile App Pro Tips**

-   When in doubt, **Refresh** to sync.
    
-   For **project-specific Rambles**, always start from _inside_ that project.
    
-   Rambles work best when you’re willing to think out loud. While the AI doesn’t need a ton to go on, some key narrative elements help it piece things together.
    

We built the iOS app for momentum—so you can keep writing even when you’re away from your desk. Whether it’s a whispered dialogue at midnight or a note you tap out on a train, the Sudowrite app helps your story stay in motion.

Got feedback? Tap the **Feedback** button in Settings. We’re all ears.

## Classes

### Curriculum Details

**Collection:** Resources > Classes
**Slug:** 4321134-curriculum-details
**ID:** 4321134
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:19:41.309Z

Sudowrite offers **free live classes** almost every day of the week. We cover a wide variety of topics, genres, and workflows, with sessions ranging from working with Sudowrite to writing craft in general.

### How the curriculum is structured

-   **Quick Start sessions** (zero Sudowrite experience required)
    
    Quick Start sessions are beginner-friendly classes that don’t assume you have a handle on Sudowrite yet. These are perfect as your first class, or if you’re returning to Sudowrite after a break.
    
-   **Deep Dive sessions** (you already know the basics)
    
    Deep Dive sessions go into more granular detail around certain workflows or processes. These sessions are able to cover more complex topics because they assume you’re already comfortable with Sudowrite fundamentals. Great for those who want to get “in the weeds” on specific tools.
    
-   **Workshops** (hands-on, create alongside an instructor)
    
    Workshops are practical, creative sessions where you can actively work on your writing with guidance—often centered on a theme (e.g., planning/goal setting, writing diverse stories, etc.).
    

### Regular weekly sessions you can always rely on

-   **Weekly Welcome Session**: a “zero to one” onboarding that walks brand-new users through the essentials and gives you the foundation to navigate Sudowrite confidently.
    
-   **Office Hours**: a looser, unstructured help session where attendees bring questions, troubleshoot workflows, and learn by watching others’ problems get solved.
    

Missed a live session? Class recordings are routinely shared in the Sudowrite Discord #**course-videos** channel.

### Why attend?

As Octavia E. Butler said, "Forget talent. If you have it, fine. Use it. If you don’t have it, it doesn’t matter. As habit is more dependable than inspiration, continued learning is more dependable than talent."

## Community

### Ambassadors

**Collection:** Resources > Community
**Slug:** 3568979-ambassadors
**ID:** 3568979
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:23:02.977Z

Sudowrite’s Ambassador program is a way for our most active and passionate authors to shape, support, and grow our community alongside us. If you’re already one of the more active voices in the community and feel like you have exciting ideas for the future of Sudowrite, this may be for you!

## What are Ambassadors?

In short, Sudowrite’s best and brightest! Ambassadors contribute to our product and community in a myriad of ways, including…

-   **Resourcing the community!** Connecting folks in our Discord and out on the world wide web to resources they need to have a great experience with Sudowrite.
    
-   **Creating videos!** Highlighting tips and best practices, exploring popular topics, and sharing these on our YouTube or in our Discord community.
    
-   **Hosting live sessions!** From classes to informal social gatherings, Ambassadors contribute significantly to our live programming efforts.
    
-   **Contributing to crowd-sourced docs!** Creating valuable documentation that helps everyone get the most out of Sudowrite.
    
-   **Giving product feedback!** Our Ambassadors get early access to new tools and features so that they can help us make them better.
    
-   …\*and many other projects which help to grow and support the Sudowrite community.
    

Sudowrite Ambassadors are invited on a quarterly basis, and active Ambassadors will be re-invited each quarter as long as they remain active and in good standing.

* * *

## Perks

Being an Ambassador is an incredible way to give back to the Sudowrite community—so here are a few ways _we_ give back to Ambassadors:

-   Free monthly Professional plan!
    
-   Featured Discord roles with special server privileges
    
-   Guaranteed early access to our latest features and beta tests
    
-   Access to the Sudowrite team, and the opportunity to offer direct feedback on our feature roadmap
    
-   And more role-specific perks too!
    

Most Ambassadors ultimately participate because they're passionate about Sudowrite and want to help others succeed. The perks are a nice bonus—we think they’re well deserved!—but the _real_ reward is being an integral part of our vibrant community and shaping the future of Sudowrite.

* * *

## How do I become an Ambassador?

We love your ambition! The first step to becoming an Ambassador is simply being an active member of community—either in our Discord server, or out there in the world. Next, you should have a clear idea for how exactly you’d like to get involved, whether that’s producing content, answering questions, or something else.

📌 While it’s not a strict requirement, we’re generally looking for folks who have been a member of our Discord community for 6+ months.

When you’re ready to apply, you can [**fill out this Ambassador application form**](https://airtable.com/appzYmPFcz9Wxzn0X/shrmqE2y2snfRhd5N). We review all applicants on a quarterly cycle, at the beginning of February, May, August, and November.

### Community Guidelines

**Collection:** Resources > Community
**Slug:** 4486684-community-guidelines
**ID:** 4486684
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:21:34.040Z

The [**Sudowrite Discord community**](https://discord.gg/sudowrite) is a place for authors and writers working with AI to hang out, share ideas, and learn from one another. There are people from all over the world and people of all ages in our community. Every day they’re experimenting and making discoveries that push the boundaries of just what you can do with AI—and the written word.

These Community Guidelines include our values, rules, and expectations of behavior. They’re intended to help us stay aligned, maintain positive vibes, and uphold a safe environment for everyone.

**Values**

**🐱 Curiosity and open mindedness** We get the best results from each other (and AI!) when we approach ideas and others with an open mind and orient ourselves around curiosity. “What if the opposite is true?” as a mantra.

**🤝 Helpfulness and friendship** We expect that everyone brings a spirit of collaboration, acts in friendship, and assumes the best of intentions. Remember, sometimes folks just haven’t had their coffee yet!

**⚙️ Experimentation and action!** The thing that makes this community awesome is the people in it—and we love to see you all take action. If you need help, ask! If you see a problem you can solve, speak up. If you have an idea for something awesome the community should do, pitch us or set it up!

**Rules**

Below you’ll find an overview of the rules by which we govern the Sudowrite community—which is not limited to but in part consists of our Discord server, our remote and in-person events, and our Plugins ecosystem.

To keep our community a warm and welcoming space, Staff members will enforce the rules below through moderation. While we expect that everyone will play by the rules, be advised that we may take action (ranging from warnings to bans) in the event that you don’t.

1️⃣ **Be kind and respectful** - Help us cultivate a welcoming environment. Operate with good intent, and assume positive intent from others. When offering feedback, make it constructive.

2️⃣ **Promote positive interactions** - We prioritize the safety and well-being of our community members. Hatred, bigotry, and harassment are all expressly prohibited here. Troll-like behavior and other forms of abuse may also result in your expulsion from the community.

3️⃣ **Respect the space** - Keep the channels on topic. Also, we welcome self-promotion as it relates to your work with Sudowrite—for example, videos, blogs or podcasts documenting your use. But self-promotion isn't cool when it means using this space for extractive, commercial, or unrelated reasons. That said, there’s a celebrations channel for a reason—celebrate your wins, or link to your freshly published books! (If you find yourself unsure, just ask Michael or any staff member.)

4️⃣ **Help keep things safe** - If you see something against the rules or something that makes you (or another community member) feel unsafe, please notify a staff member. And if you see something that isn’t against the letter of the rules, but feels against the _spirit_, please let us know.

**Expectations of Behavior**

Sudowrite Staff members, Ambassadors, and sometimes other members of the community will host events—ranging from product tours, to informal co-working sessions, to genre happy hours, to structured classes. These events may take place in audio or video channels in Discord, over Zoom, or occasionally even in-person.

We encourage you attend and participate in these events, but we do have some baseline expectations of behavior for those doing so. Event attendees agree to:

**📗 Share the floor** - We want you to get your questions answered in any session you attend, but we also ask that you be aware of the space you take. That way, other attendees have the time and opportunity to have their questions answered as well.

**📙 Bring mindfulness and respect** - You’re joining a shared space, and we ask you to conduct yourself accordingly. This includes muting yourself or turning your camera off proactively or when asked, and maintaining composure in the chat.

**📕 Listen to teacher** - Different instructors may have different rules for their sessions—raised hands only, queue up questions in the chat, etc.—depending on the format, topic, and attendance. We expect that, in those situations, you will defer to your instructor’s preferences.

###  Can I hide information from the AI?

**Collection:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Slug:** 5578433-can-i-hide-information-from-the-ai
**ID:** 5578433
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:27:54.491Z

Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just click the eyeball icon that appears on the Character card when you hover your cursor over them.

**When the eyeball is clicked (and appears struck-through), Sudowrite’s AI will ignore that card or trait altogether.**

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character Card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine _may_ consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. You can prevent this by hiding the Motive from Sudowrite’s AI, which you’d do by toggling the visibility of the trait field itself.

Just hover over a trait field and click the eyeball. Once the eyeball appears struck-through, the trait is hidden from Sudowrite’s AI.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6fb9bd18c364828017b5/019be1cf-b251-7c8b-9288-687708c2c745/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2266c6250680c497f885faa6c7b46d4204298a30b51d8cf0713896e2c2ed2b2b)

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise by dictating what is visible, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.

### Can I use Sudowrite in other languages?

**Collection:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Slug:** 2487986-can-i-use-sudowrite-in-other-languages
**ID:** 2487986
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:23:30.302Z

You can write text in almost any language, and Sudowrite’s Write button will (usually!) automatically match your language in its suggestions. When using other features, like the Draft tool or Plugins, you may have found that Sudowrite sometimes falls back on English.

While there's currently no single "Language" setting for your Sudowrite account, Sudowrite users all around the world have managed to get the tool to consistently generate prose in languages like German, Italian, French, Danish, and more. One way to do so is by simply including a line in your instructions—whether that’s the Plugin prompt field, the Extra Instructions field, or even just in your document/highlight—that says `[Write all output in X]` _in_ your preferred language.

If you’re looking for other tips on how to get Sudowrite to consistently write in your preferred language, you should join our community Discord server and ask folks in the Multilingual channel for their advice! You can find our Discord server here: [discord.gg/sudowrite](https://discord.gg/sudowrite)

### Does Sudowrite have a status page?

**Collection:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Slug:** 0904575-does-sudowrite-have-a-status-page
**ID:** 0904575
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:26:15.695Z

Yes! You can keep track of Sudowrite’s current status at [https://status.sudowrite.com/](https://status.sudowrite.com/).

In the event that Sudowrite or one of our AI model providers experiences downtime or an outage, we will create and update an incident report on our status page. We’ll update you on our investigations and resolutions at the incident report on that status page.

You can sign up for email notifications to stay current, or join our Discord community where we cross-post these notifications to a #status channel. (That status channel in Discord also highlights outages documented by our AI providers.)

Here’s an embedded preview of the Sudowrite status page:

### Is there a mobile app?

**Collection:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Slug:** 4862190-is-there-a-mobile-app
**ID:** 4862190
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:23:48.531Z

Yes! We’ve just launched a mobile iOS app—and we’re currently in beta with our Android app as well. This app is a companion app rather than a replacement for Sudowrite’s web editor. That means it does not include all of the AI functions you’d have on the web (but it does have one really neat mobile-specific feature). You can learn more about Sudowrite for iOS here: [Using the Sudowrite Mobile App](/1ea7975fa0ec800cbf78e8ffcb4d3b2c)

### What accessibility options are available?

**Collection:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Slug:** 2943388-what-accessibility-options-are-available
**ID:** 2943388
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:25:32.305Z

We think that every writer should be empowered to tell their story, so there are a handful of features on Sudowrite intended to help make that possible.

First, Sudowrite’s Settings (⚙️) include a number of accessibility options. One of those is the OpenDyslexic font which is intended to reduce some of the more common reading errors associated with dyslexia. Another is our Themes, which is how and where you would enable Dark Mode (try _Charcoal_ for that)—but Themes also provide a range of color palettes so you can select something that works best for your vision.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6fa95b069893d402d3d1/019be1cd-d71a-7312-bbb7-2c07a735f4d1/b64u-aW1hZ2UucG5n.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T190000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=99394cfeee70a03218f7cd993d764ded044090666c91105410ac32329ee20d82)

We’ve also recently made some big improvements to the way that Sudowrite works with screen readers—so if you’re a screen reader user, you should now have an easier time navigating Sudowrite

While not _explicitly_ an accessibility tool, several users have flagged that Plugins—our versatile build-your-own-AI-feature toolkit—have improved their Sudowrite experience. There are even tools such as the [Disability sensitivity reader](https://www.sudowrite.com/app/plugin/j3dQ5j6Ia/sensitivity-reader-disability) that have been built as a result.

For more on accessibility, we’d recommend connecting with other members of our community—especially our Ambassadors—in the Sudowrite community Discord server here: [https://discord.gg/sudowrite](https://discord.gg/sudowrite). And for feature requests in particular, you can flag those to our attention in the Discord, use [our feedback board here](https://feedback.sudowrite.com/), or email us at: [hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com).

# Legal Stuff

## The Fine Print

### Intellectual Property and Ownership

**Collection:** Legal Stuff > The Fine Print
**Slug:** 4567979-intellectual-property-and-ownership
**ID:** 4567979
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:31:30.358Z

### Ownership Rights

We understand it's super important for you to retain ownership over the content you create, so whether you use Sudowrite to brainstorm, enhance your ideas, or fine-tune your writing, all the writing you generate remains yours. When you input text into Sudowrite and use its features to generate or improve content, the output is based on your initial input and creative direction. This means that the resulting content, enriched or transformed by Sudowrite, is considered your intellectual property. You have initiated the creative process, and therefore, the contributions made by Sudowrite in response to your inputs are yours to own, use, and distribute as you see fit.

### Plagiarism

You may have heard of concerns regarding plagiarism where AI is concerned. Sudowrite won't plagiarize unless you _force it_ to plagiarize, which is against our Terms of Service.

AI works by guessing one word at a time, based on general concepts it has learned from billions of samples of text. That means it's _extremely unlikely_ to produce the same words verbatim, or even ever again. It does not copy and paste chunks of text, it guesses each word—technically, _parts_ of words—one at a time.

The only way to potentially get unoriginal content out of Sudowrite is to use text the AI has seen a lot before verbatim, like the lyrics of a popular song, or the first paragraph of an extremely popular book like Harry Potter. As long as your input is original, you'll get original writing out of Sudowrite. Of course, we encourage you to try plagiarism checkers to verify your results.

### Privacy Policy

**Collection:** Legal Stuff > The Fine Print
**Slug:** 8944320-privacy-policy
**ID:** 8944320
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:33:08.353Z

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

## Automatic collection of information

When you open the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends.

Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

## Collection of personal information

You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). In addition, if you link your Google account or accounts from other third party services, we also get information from those accounts. The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies. We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, or fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:

-   Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
    
-   Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
    
-   Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.
    
-   Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.
    

Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

## Use and processing of collected information

In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:

-   Create and manage user accounts
    
-   Send administrative information
    
-   Respond to inquiries and offer support
    
-   Improve Products and Services
    
-   Request user feedback
    
-   Improve user experience
    
-   Enforce terms and conditions and policies
    
-   Protect from abuse and malicious users
    
-   Respond to legal requests and prevent harm
    
-   Run and operate the Website and Services
    

Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

## Disclosure of information

Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.

We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

## Retention of information

We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

## Transfer of information

Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.

## The rights of users

You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

## The right to object to processing

Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.

## Data protection rights under GDPR

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights and the Operator aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Information.

In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:

-   You have the right to request access to your Personal Information that we store and have the ability to access your Personal Information.
    
-   You have the right to request that we correct any Personal Information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is incomplete.

You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European Economic Area (EEA).

## California privacy rights

In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal Information (as defined in the statute) to obtain products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the Personal Information we shared, if any, with other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in the current year will receive information about the prior year). To obtain this information please contact us.

## How to exercise these rights

Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to the Operator through the contact details provided in this document. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the person you are claiming to be or that you are the authorized representative of such person. You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first verify your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you.

## Privacy of children

We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Cookies

The Website and Services use "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website and Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit [internetcookies.org](https://www.internetcookies.org/).

## Do Not Track signals

Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.

## Email marketing

We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties except as allowed in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.

## Links to other resources

The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.

## Information security

We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.

## Data breach

In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.

## Changes and amendments

We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.

Policy was created with [WebsitePolicies](https://www.websitepolicies.com/privacy-policy-generator).

## Acceptance of this policy

You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Website and Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services.

### Terms and Conditions

**Collection:** Legal Stuff > The Fine Print
**Slug:** 5765112-terms-and-conditions
**ID:** 5765112
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T18:32:20.432Z

These terms and conditions ("Agreement") sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com) website ("Website" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services").

You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.

**Credit Allocation and Use**

You will receive a specific allotment of monthly credits in accordance with the tier of your chosen subscription plan. Credits will be added to your account each month on the Credit Renewal Date, which falls on the same date each month as your original subscription date, adjusted for shorter months. Credits are intended for the utilization of services and features offered within the scope of your subscription. Credits have no cash value and are non-transferable. Monthly credits remaining unused as of your Credit Renewal Date will expire and will no longer be available for use. If you are subscribed to a plan featuring a credit rollover provision, you will be entitled to retain unused credits as long as you are an active subscriber. Such credits will be eligible for use for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months from their initial date of issuance. You may, at your discretion, purchase additional credits independent of your monthly allocation. These additional credits will be exempt from expiration and will remain available until fully expended. Credits, regardless of provenance, can only be used with an active subscription.

**Refunds and Cancellation**

Your subscription to Website and Services will renew automatically each month. You may cancel your subscription at any time from the account membership page or by emailing us at the address listed below. Due to the nature of digital services, we do not refund fees on cancellation. If you downgrade to a lower tier plan, you will retain access to your previous plan until your renewal date. If you upgrade to a higher tier plan, you will receive a pro-rated refund of unused time on your previous plan when you are charged for your new plan.
