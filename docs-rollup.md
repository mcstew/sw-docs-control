### The Basics

**Collection:** Getting Started > Introduction
**Slug:** 8701784-the-basics
**ID:** 8701784

The world of AI-assisted writing is rapidly evolving and unlike anything before. So you’re probably wondering, how exactly does this thing work and how can I get the most out of it?

Like any tool, the person wielding it is ultimately responsible for the quality of results. This is a good thing because it means the writing you get from Sudowrite will be different from what everyone else gets, and there’s no limit to what you can create.

## 1.) Sudowrite works by reading your text, and then generating text based on what it sees.

This has a couple of important implications:

-   **The more you put in your document the better** - Sudowrite needs to see enough content to understand what story you are trying to tell in order to give you good results. Try writing, or pasting in, _at least a few paragraphs_ to get it started in the right direction.
    

-   **Junk in, junk out** - Sudowrite assumes that everything in your document is _something that you like_. That means that if you put suggestions you only kinda like into your document, Sudowrite will keep giving you more suggestions that you only kinda like. To get better suggestions, make sure what’s in the document is at the level you want.
    

-   **The Write button looks at (at least) 1,000 words before your cursor** - If there is important information you want Write to take into account before generating text, add it to the Key Details box in Write Settings—or your Story Bible. Or, in Guided mode, _tell_ Sudowrite what to write and it will follow your instructions. Click the drop down arrow directly to the right of the Write button to find these options.
    

## 2.) Sudowrite is kind of random (on purpose)

-   Think of Sudowrite suggestions as pitches from a writing partner. You can take them, leave them, or improve them to get the best result. A “yes, and” mindset is ideal for working with AI (just like with humans)!
    

-   Sometimes Sudowrite will say something that seems super random. That doesn’t mean you did anything wrong, or that there’s a problem with Sudowrite—but it does suggest you should try to understand why the AI made that choice. Try a second time, and see if you get better results. If not, or if you find you have to press the button 3-5 times to get a result you like… 👇
    

## 3.) There’s always a way to improve your results

-   Choosing the right feature can help you get better results
    
    -   **Write**
        
        -   _Auto_ is for when you don’t know what should come next and you just want to see what the AI comes up with.
            
        -   _Guided_ is for when you have an idea of what should happen but want Sudowrite to draft it for you.
            
    
    -   **Describe** adds rich sensory details—sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste—to any moment or object.
        
    
    -   **Rewrite** improves phrasing, flow, or tone in an existing passage.
        
    
    -   **Brainstorm** helps generate lists of ideas: names, powers, plot twists, worldbuilding elements, and more.
        
    
    -   **First Draft** generates an extended scene (typically 500–1,000+ words) based on an outline or set of notes.
        
    
    -   **Expand** adds length to your draft—whether that means slowing pacing or fleshing out a moment. _(Tip: Use Describe if what you need is added detail.)_
        
    
    -   **Plugins** are customizable tools that extend Sudowrite’s core functionality. Use them to tweak tone, change POV, enhance dialogue, and more.
        
    
    -   **Scenes** (found in the Draft tool) are the new, structured way to outline and generate your chapters. Each scene focuses on a specific time, place, or POV, and supports **Extra Instructions** to guide tone, pacing, and style. (Note: Scenes replaced the older _Beats_ system.)
        

-   If you’re not getting the kind of results you want after trying a few times - look at the input you gave Sudowrite. Ask yourself **_“Why would Sudowrite think this is OK?”._** You will probably be able to find a reason, or an opportunity to clarify.
    
    -   Example: You are writing a werewolf story and you wrote that the moon is showing, but Sudowrite is not suggesting that the character turn into a werewolf. Isn’t it obvious that should happen? Solution: It turns out there was no mention of the werewolf aspect of this character in the previous 1,000 words, so Write did not know. You use Guided Write and tell Sudowrite to write the transformation, and it works perfectly.
        

-   If the writing you’re getting is not in your voice, look at your document and remove anything that isn’t a match to what you’d like Sudowrite to write for you. Or, use Rewrite to improve it.

### Glossary

**Collection:** Getting Started > Sudowrite Manual
**Slug:** 1326552-glossary
**ID:** 1326552
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:03:04.200Z

Whether you’re attending classes or reading documentation, there’s a good chance you may encounter some jargon along the way. This glossary is intended to clarify any terms that may be ambiguous—whether they’re related to Sudowrite, artificial intelligence, or writing craft.

### List of Helpful Terms

1.  **Scenes:** One of the foundational building blocks of chapters in Sudowrite’s Draft tool are scenes. Each Scene represents a discrete moment in your story—typically unified by location, time, or point of view. Scenes support _Extra Instructions_ (such as tone, pacing, or style notes), and have replaced the older _Beats_ system for prose generation.
    
2.  **Boxes:** Within Sudowrite, boxes are generally in reference to text fields—specifically the “boxes” associated with the Story Bible feature (Style box, Genre box, etc.).
    
3.  **Brainstorm:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, Brainstorm is a tool for generating fresh ideas for anything from plot points to settings to character names. The user can thumbs down to generate fresh ideas, or thumbs up to add something to a keepers list—which will be saved to their History section once they Save and Exit the tool.
    
4.  **Canvas:** Canvas is a feature that allows users to map out their outline or character relationships visually, using drag and drop elements such as cards and boxes.
    
5.  **Cards:** Cards appear in a couple of places within the Sudowrite interface, and may refer to Project Cards (on the [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com/) homepage) or the outputs of AI functions (such as Write) which appear in Cards in the History column.
    
6.  **Generator (Deprecated):** This was the precursor to the Draft tool and Scenes. It allowed users to generate prose from _beats_, which have since been phased out. As of March 31, 2025, Beats are no longer supported and were automatically converted into Scenes.
    
7.  **Chapter Continuity:** A feature of Sudowrite that allows you to tell which document precedes which, in order to help the AI achieve improved narrative consistency, pacing, and character arcs. Some authors have called this “chapter glue” in the past when distilling the critical events of a chapter was a manual process, but Sudowrite now reads back across sequential documents for you.
    
8.  **Credits:** Credits are the currency of Sudowrite. The different plans available come with different amounts of monthly credits, and those credits are used towards Sudowrite’s AI functions.
    
9.  **Describe:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, Describe will generate sensory descriptions (for Sight, Smell, Taste, Sound, Touch, and Metaphor) for a highlighted selection of text.
    
10.  **Document:** Documents are essentially text files that appear in a list format inside of a Project’s left bar. They’re used to divide your Project, either into Chapters or otherwise.
     
11.  **Drivers:** These are elements that move a story forward. They may be major plot points, character decisions, or events that create conflict and propel the narrative towards its resolution.
     
12.  **Extra Instructions:** An optional input field available in each Scene within the Draft tool. It allows you to guide the AI on tone, pacing, POV, or other stylistic choices, helping shape more intentional prose.
     
13.  **Focus:** This is not too far off its base definition, but within Sudowrite it often refers to maintaining clarity and relevance in the scene. It involves ensuring that the action contributes meaningfully to the overall story.
     
14.  **Guardrails:** This typically refers to the boundaries or rules that you set for your scene, helping to keep any AI generations on track. They may include genre conventions, character motivations, and thematic limits.
     
15.  **Hover Menu:** When selecting a passage of text within the editor, a hover menu will appear for quick access to potentially relevant tools.
     
16.  **Kitbashing:** Originally a term from model building (where parts from different kits are combined), this term generally refers to the process of combining/merging various elements or parts of different drafts (or AI generations) to build a desired work.
     
17.  **Laser Tools:** This colloquialism is used by the community in reference to Sudowrite’s targeted AI features, such as Rewrite.
     
18.  **LLM:** Large Language Model, a type of AI that can understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It's the technology that (alongside a few others) powers tools like Sudowrite.
     
19.  **Match My Style:** This is a feature inside of Story Bible that analyzes an authors work and produces a Style prompt in order to help the AI more faithfully replicate the user's writing style.
     
20.  **Model:** In AI terminology, a model refers to a trained AI system that can process input data (like text) and generate output based on its training. Examples may include GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro, and more. Different models work behind the scenes of Sudowrite, but are also available to select explicitly when building Plugins.
     
21.  **Plugins:** In Sudowrite, Plugins are custom community-built features that can be installed and used to extend Sudowrite’s functionality. They may generate, transform, or analyze text—or do any combination of those things.
     
22.  **Prose:** This generally references the written text in your Sudowrite document, but depending on the usage it may be an explicit reference to the “prose” output by Sudowrite’s Draft tool or the Write button.
     
23.  **Project:** In Sudowrite, a Project refer to a discrete writing project—often a single novel or story—that is represented by a Project card on Sudowrite’s homepage. Projects may contain many documents, but each Project only has a single Canvas and Story Bible.
     
24.  **Project Cards:** Visual representations of projects within Sudowrite, providing quick access to different writing projects and their details.
     
25.  **Prompt:** A text input given to an AI or software tool to generate specific output or perform an action, often used in creative writing to inspire or guide the AI's output.
     
26.  **Prose Mode:** This is a Sudowrite-specific term for the AI selected for a task (in either the Write settings or the Draft tool). It includes Muse, Excellent, Basic, and experimental AI models (which have not been as extensively tested or optimized) as well.
     
27.  **Quick Edit / Quick Chat:** Available within the hover menu upon text selection or via a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + K, ⌘ + K), Quick Edit allows for instruction-based edits. Quick Chat was a lightweight inline chat, but that has been deprecated in favor of a richer, full “Chat” that now lives in the right bar. Previously referred to as “Quick Tools.”
     
28.  **Rewrite:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, the Rewrite button can be used on a selection of text to transform it according to the selected Rewrite style (ranging from Shorter, to Rephrase, to Show Not Tell). It also appears in the hover menu upon selection.
     
29.  **Series:** This is a reference to someone’s sequential works, often novels, that exist within the same universe.
     
30.  **Story Bible:** Sudowrite’s Story Bible is a feature available inside of each Project that lets you document (and/or generate) and store necessary storytelling components for the AI’s reference—to keep your AI-generated assistance on track. It includes Braindump, Genre, Style, Synopsis, Characters, and Outline.
     
31.  **Story Engine (Legacy):** An earlier term used interchangeably with Story Bible. While you may still see “Story Engine” in older videos or guides, most references now point to the combined tools of Brainstorm, Story Bible, and the Draft interface, which together help structure your novel.
     
32.  **Sudowrite Proper:** Another colloquialism, this generally references the interior of a Sudowrite project—inclusive of the editor, toolbar, (left) project nav, and (right) history bar.
     
33.  **Token:** In artificial intelligence, a token is a measurement of text processed and/or generated by AI. You won’t see or tokens measurements or numbers on Sudowrite, but they’re to be aware of in the event people are discussing “context limits” for model (as in Plugin building).
     
34.  **Write Button:** One of the core AI tools in a project’s toolbar, the Write button is like an advanced autocomplete that can generate anywhere from a 50-500 word completion from wherever you leave the cursor. In the Write Button’s dropdown, you’ll find variants of the Write button including Guided Write (which works similarly but takes or offers suggestions) and Tone Shift (which continues in the selected tone).
     
35.  **Write Settings:** This is an option available in the dropdown next to the Write button, which allows you to define how that button works. You can select creativity, the number of cards, card length, and even the Prose Mode.

### Interface

**Collection:** Getting Started > Sudowrite Manual

# Sudowrite Main Interface

Sudowrite’s main writing interface is divided into 3 columns.

In the left column you have the Project’s Document organization. The primary writing area, your text editor, comprises the middle section. Finally, to the right is the information section and where responses from Sudowrite’s AI tools and Plugins will appear as Cards. (Note that before you get started, that area is populated by a few quick tips.)

![A screenshot of Sudowrite’s editor, the main writing interface.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6859b8261546fe601b93/0198aeb0-602c-7001-bd79-bb969cf4a25d/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjAtNWVjYy03NTI1LTgzYTAtMjEzNjNkNzFhMGYy.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9d85b82a347cacd937ec7bc1fc67c086eb62ddcfa85506bdbd65367b4ed6034a)

A screenshot of Sudowrite’s editor, the main writing interface.

## Projects, Docs and Folders

On login, you’re dropped into Sudowrite’s homepage. That’s where you’ll find all of your **Projects**. Click into any project to enter the editor (as depicted above), where you’ll find your **Document**(s) listed along the left. You can **Add New** documents or **Import** your existing work here in the left nav—in either case, those individual docs will be listed there. Add New also gives you the option of creating **Folders**, which can be used to organize your Documents.

Meanwhile, each of Sudowrite’s AI functions (highlighted below) outputs results as Cards, which appear in the History bar on the right side of the text editor.

## Cards

Most Sudowrite features will place your responses into a **Card** on the right side of the screen. (First Draft, and Quick Edit do not.)

![Sudowrite’s main interface places the AI responses from Sudowrite’s AI features into cards on the right side of the screen. You can click on the cards to expand the stacks, or click again to collapse them.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6859b8261546fe601b93/0198aeb0-5f60-78c3-b93f-0c43b3969ef0/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjAtNWU3NC03ZjM1LWE0YzQtYjBiMjhiN2JmNDU4.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=dd0cf8ae20a425387bec6354a05154b3720f12325e5c9330ec54a38fc4f6be1b)

Sudowrite’s main interface places the AI responses from Sudowrite’s AI features into cards on the right side of the screen. You can click on the cards to expand the stacks, or click again to collapse them.

Click anywhere on the white card to collapse the response, and click again to expand it and view the full context of the prompt and response. The top of every card pile will have the _Prompt_ in italics: this is what Sudowrite took into consideration in order to generate the cards. It also will name the feature you used. In the example below, it was Write.

![The prompt that Sudowrite considered is always in italics above the Cards.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6859b8261546fe601b93/0198aeb0-5f38-7b0c-9621-b358d4cabdfd/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjAtNWU4MS03MmY0LWE1ODQtMWVlMmUzN2E1ODEx.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a90726d1b1f981a6790ba4ad9805e5b954c65874bade31e48f6b66a0843d79e7)

The prompt that Sudowrite considered is always in italics above the Cards.

The last part of the interface to be aware of is the Toolbar that sits along the top of those three columns. The Toolbar is where you’ll find several of Sudowrite’s core AI features, which you can read more about next.

## Onboarding to Sudowrite

When you first sign up for Sudowrite you’re dropped directly into a product tour that offers a guided walkthrough of some core features. If you breezed through that, or it’s just been a while and you’d like a refresher, you can always take that tour again.

To do so, just click on the gear icon (⚙️) up in the top right corner of the interface to access your **Account Settings**, then select **Start Tour**.

![The upper right corner of Sudowrite when you’re inside a project. The gear icon is your Account Settings.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6817df8d39c440bbcaf4/0198aeaf-851c-7761-9847-90229b3baa25/b64u-MDE5OGFlYWYtODRmNC03YTdiLWE5NzAtMjI3NDM1MWE3Y2Jm.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f645949ed4cf605089e1a8a8fe4145e2c6be11676324d157ed87f73da45f2145)

**Sudowrite Simplified transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a full transcript is available by expanding this toggle.

Whether you write novels or non-fiction, Sudowrite is the fastest way to get your ideas out of your head and onto the page… but before you can get started, it helps to know your way around the software.

Today we’ll review Sudowrite’s interface and features, and showcase how you can use it to brainstorm, write, edit, and stay organized.

For starters, I'm going to click this Home button in the upper left so we can start from the Sudowrite homepage. The homepage is where all of your projects appear.

Projects are represented by these little cards, which showcase a project title, a snippet from the first document inside of the project, a word count and an edited date. These three buttons expand a menu that will let you delete a project—and if you have deleted a project, you’ll see a Trash over here. This is also where you’ll find a Plugins button—Plugins are user-created features, which are a bit more advanced, so we’ll cover those in another video but feel free to explore them on your own too.

Down here on the right are some pinned resources and reference materials—for example, this link to our live classes.

In the upper right here, you'll see a gear. This is the Settings for Sudowrite. If I expand it, I'll see my Account Details, but then also some Controls so I can customize my Sudowrite experience—everything from the font and text size to line spacing to the actual color palette that Sudowrite uses here in the Theme.

Now I'm going to click into an existing project here to get started. Let’s begin by taking a quick look at the Sudowrite user interface. There are four main sections of it that you should know about. The primary section right here is the Editor. On its own, this rich text editor should look familiar, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. You’ll see a Find & Replace button and formatting options along the top here.

Off to the right, you see a History section, which is where “cards” with AI-generated text will appear when you use most of Sudowrite’s AI features. The card gives you the chance to review the AI-generated text before inserting it into your document, and you can always refer back to it—or even star it to save it in a short list for later.

In this left bar, you'll see the name of your project up top, and then all of the documents inside of your project down below. Documents are often chapters, but you can actually organize this section however you like. Your Documents will be titled automatically once you've written a sufficient amount inside of the body of the doc, but you can also rename them either by clicking on the three dots or by double-clicking the title. The same goes for your project title—rename it by clicking on it.

You can add a new document by clicking Add New, or you can upload an existing document from your computer.

The fourth section of the interface is the feature toolbar along the top. These are the main AI features of Sudowrite, which you can learn more about by hovering your cursor over… but we’ll dive into them right now.

Let’s start with Brainstorm. If I click on it, I'm prompted with this, which lets me select from any of the different things I could brainstorm. No matter what you select, the Brainstorm tool looks and works the same—it just changes the prepopulated sample text for your reference.

Click the refresh button to change the sample text up—or provide your own Brainstorm prompt.

Once I click Start, I'm sent directly into the Brainstorm flow. I can use the little thumbs up to add something to my keepers list, or the thumbs down if I don’t like something and want to receive a new suggestion. Once I have a Keepers list I'm happy with, I can click Save and Exit, and you'll see the results of that Brainstorm session appear in my history column.

There is another way to brainstorm, and that's by using what we call Chat. You’ll find Chat in the right column next to the History tab where your AI cards appear. You can also get to it by using a keyboard shortcut, which is Control K on a PC or Command K on a Mac then pressing Tab.

Chat is where you can ask a question, say… ask for some interesting settings for your Sci-Fi story. Chat can see what you highlight, along with the context of your Story Bible, and make a suggestion.

With Brainstorming out of the way, let’s look at Writing on Sudowrite. To help illustrate this next point, I’ve added a sample story to this document. When writing it I got stuck… but if I want Sudowrite to help me continue it, I just click the Write button.

The Write button is like a super advanced autocomplete that gives me suggestions on how to proceed. It won't change anything in the body of my document, but instead it will generate cards in the History column. If you want a little more control over how write works, you can click this arrow to the right of the button—here you’ll find Guided Write, which provides or accepts generalized suggestions on how to proceed, and Tone Shift, which works just like Write but in a tone that maps to whatever you select here. You also have full control over Write’s Auto mode here in the settings… in case you wanted to crank up the creativity, change the length of the cards that are produced, or even toggle prose modes. (Prose modes will change the output a bit, since you’re essentially changing the AI that’s doing the work for you.)

Now, if in the course of writing you realize you need to flesh out some details, you can use what we call the Describe button. So if I highlight "ancient items and mystical objects" here, I can use the Describe button to get a more detailed description of those things. Clicking this dropdown to the right of Describe will show you all of the senses that Describe will generate a card for—if you don’t need to smell the high school locker room, make sure you toggle that off before clicking Describe on that phrase. When clicking Describe, you'll see the results in the right column just like other AI outputs. Along the bottom of each card here you’ll see both an Insert and a Copy button, but you can also highlight any section that works for you, copy it, and just paste that into your document.

When it comes to editing your work, you have a few options available. I mentioned Quick Edit earlier—that’s available from the hover menu when you highlight something, but also by the Command K / Control K shortcut. Quick Edit is about as simple as it gets—just tell it what you want to change about your work. You can say “expand on this,” “rephrase this” or “change this to first person.” You’ll get a struck-through version of your original prose, and underlined in green you’ll see the suggested replacement—which you can then accept, reject, or further edit by providing follow-up instructions.

The other main way to edit is with what we call the Rewrite button. Just highlight a section you’d like to rewrite, up to 6000 words, then click Rewrite. A Rewrite selector will appear in the History bar, where you’ll choose how you want the Rewrite to work—shorter, more show, not tell, or even if I want to do something custom. So I can customize this and say, be more quirky or make this really dark and foreboding. For now, let's just use rephrase. When I say go, Rewrite gets to work. And you'll see the rephrase suggestion appears in my right column here. If I like what I see and I click Insert, it replaces the text that I already had highlighted.

Finally, when it comes to staying organized on SudoWrite, there are two main ways for you to do that. The first is Canvas, which is a visual way to stay organized. If you’re someone who likes to visually map things out before you get to work, Canvas lets you do that. You can generate full outlines, move cards around, even visualize and track your character relationships here.

The other way to stay organized is called Story Bible, and it’s one of Sudowrite’s more advanced features. Story Bible is a place for structured notes— it’s where you can put all of the details you know for sure about your story. So you'll see Braindump, Genre, Style, Synopsis, Characters, and Outline. The idea is everything you know for sure can go here, but anything you don't know or want a little help with can be generated with some help from AI.

So once you've added a Braindump and a Genre and a Style, you could generate a Synopsis. If the generation doesn't map to your vision, you can manually change that before proceeding to the next step. You have the option to generate something like a characters list (which would pull in any characters you’ve already mentioned, while generating some new ones)... but you can also bring your own character list entirely.

The goal is to fill out your entire Story Bible and gather those essential storytelling components in one place. If you complete your Story Bible, you even have the option to generate chapter-by-chapter prose… you would do that using the Chapter Generator in a document. The best part is, with a full Story Bible, tools like Write get smarter—they’ll refer to your genre, tone, and character list to make sure they’re sticking to the project parameters you’ve defined.

Story Bible is powerful, and quick to learn, but more difficult to master. For a deep dive on it, I’d recommend attending one of our live classes, or even joining our super active Sudowrite community Discord server where we share class recordings.

That’s it for our introduction, but let us know what questions you might have in the comments here. See you in the Discord, and Happy Writing.

## Credits

### Can I track my credit usage?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 3620968-can-i-track-my-credit-usage
**ID:** 3620968
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:16:13.915Z

Your credit usage can be tracked through the Recent Activity log, accessible via the Settings menu—just click the (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right, and select “Show Recent Activity” from the Settings panel. This log provides a detailed list of the features you've used and the credits consumed by each, helping you monitor and manage your credit use.

### Do credits roll over?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 8376305-do-credits-roll-over
**ID:** 8376305
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:16:13.915Z

Unused credits expire at the end of your billing cycle, on both the **Hobby & Student** and **Professional** plans.

For example, if you signed up at 2:02pm ET on the 5th of February, unused credits will expire and new credits will be added on the 5th of each month at 2:02pm ET.

If, on the other hand, you signed up on the 31st, on months where there is no 31st day, your billing cycle ends on the last day of the month.

The exception is for **Max** plan subscribers. As long as you have an active subscription on the Max plan, your unused credits do not expire and will instead roll over for up to 12 months from date of issue.

There is actually one other exception, and that’s _purchased_ credits on any plan. If you run out of credits _before_ your monthly refresh, you do have the option of purchasing more. Purchased credits do not expire, and will remain on your account indefinitely in case you exhaust your monthly allotment again in the future.

### How many credits do features use?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 6362317-how-many-credits-do-features-use
**ID:** 6362317
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:16:13.915Z

Since credit use is calculated based on a task’s complexity, **different features on Sudowrite use different numbers of credits**. Simple, targeted features like Write or Describe are very credit-efficient—whereas asking Sudowrite to generate a full chapter of prose from your Scenes will consume quite a few credits.

We worked up this chart to illustrate the potential range, but it’s important to note that even these numbers may vary, given that you can select alternative Prose Modes or AI models to do the work.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f696667df40e13a88b842/0198aeb4-3b1a-75da-89e5-d518ca7a7765/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjQtM2E1ZC03NTRlLTgxNGEtYWJlYTI2MWIwMThi.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f725a45333c49b614533ea5716c20ae112cb07af8e23146614c477789ca94e86)

While credits power Sudowrite’s AI features, not _every_ feature of Sudowrite uses up credits. **Our Quick Edit and Chat features are** **included** **with your Sudowrite plan, and free to use by default.** (Though an optional High Quality mode, which _will_ use credits, is available in both.) We’ve also been known to introduce free-to-use models and beta tests on a time-limited basis.

### What are credits?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 3330910-what-are-credits
**ID:** 3330910
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:16:13.915Z

Each Sudowrite plan tier receives a set amount of credits each month, and those credits are then used towards Sudowrite’s AI features.

Think of credits like arcade tokens. You’ll redeem some credits each time you use an AI feature—exactly _how many_ credits depends on what you’re doing, just like some arcade games use a single token while the air hockey table uses a fist full. When it comes to Sudowrite, the number of credits used depends on the complexity of a task (which means the number of words read, words written, and the AI model doing the work).

All this means is **there’s no 1:1 relationship between the words you generate and the number of credits used**. By way of an example, the 1 million credits of the Professional plan might allow you to generate anywhere from 50,000 to 300,000 AI words in a month (depending entirely on how you go about it).

### What if I need more credits?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Credits
**Slug:** 9958048-what-if-i-need-more-credits
**ID:** 9958048
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:16:13.915Z

If you’ve exhausted your monthly credit allotment but would like to keep using Sudowrite’s AI features, you can make one-time purchases of extra credits as necessary. You’ll receive a banner with a link in the event you run out of your monthly credits, but you can also find this option at any time inside of your Settings—just click the (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right, and then select Buy More Credits.

> **Note:** In order to purchase additional credits, you must have an active Sudowrite subscription.

Purchased credits do not expire. They remain associated with your account until they are used up—even if you pause or cancel—but do note that you need to have an active account in order to use them.

It’s also worth noting that Sudowrite will always default to using monthly credits first. That means that if you’ve purchased credits and then see your monthly credits refresh hit your account, Sudowrite will automatically start using the credits that will expire at the end of the month. This helps you reserve the non-expiring purchased credits for the future, in the event that you exhaust your monthly credits again.

### How do I pause or cancel?

**ID:** 6438230
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:06:14.092Z

To pause or cancel your account, click on the Settings (⚙️) gear icon in the top right corner of Sudowrite, and select "Manage Membership." From there, you'll find options to either pause or cancel your subscription, manage your billing, or contact us.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6931c3bf18c3d82300a8/0198aeb3-621e-745e-8af5-3ab1917a6b69/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjMtNWY1YS03YmM1LWExNzEtNDU4ODdiODNiMWY0.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=95e1ca355b0565e3b32e7c1c037cd68c9c7cf68dd7b8a1f5b37ebede20573edd)

## What’s the difference between “pausing” and “canceling”?

### Pausing

Pausing a Sudowrite subscription is only available to users on monthly plans. This is because a pause takes effect at the end of your billing cycle, and monthly plans renew every month, while annual plans only renew once a year.

When you pause your subscription, you can temporarily stop your billing and credit refresh for up to **three months**. However, pausing requires an additional confirmation step that’s easy to miss. After initiating the pause, you’ll be taken to a separate confirmation page. If this step is not completed, the pause won’t go through. We recommend double-checking your status or referring to the help screenshot, which may need an update for clarity.

### Canceling

Canceling your subscription is a permanent stop to your billing cycle. This action ends your plan’s credit refresh and future payments, but your projects and documents remain accessible. If you're on an annual plan, canceling is the only available option to end your subscription, as pausing is not supported. Keep in mind that you’ll need an active subscription to access any AI features—even if your documents are still viewable.

In short, pausing is a temporary suspension for monthly users, while canceling fully stops billing and renewals. Both actions preserve your work, but only an active plan enables continued use of Sudowrite’s AI tools.

We recognize that sometimes things come up that require special consideration! If you have questions about pausing or canceling your plan, please drop us a note at: [hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com)

### How do I upgrade?

**ID:** 3173600
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:05:09.521Z

We make it easy to pause, cancel or switch plans. If you decide to change plans, your billing will be adjusted accordingly. If moving to a higher-tier plan, you’ll receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of your current plan, and your billing cycle will restart immediately under the new plan.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6903ad16f2bb98ef5dcb/0198aeb2-c25e-73b0-b434-22a56448873b/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjItYmVjZC03Nzc3LTg1YTQtMWM4YjNkMTRhZTBj.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7a40245f788c1aeb945636aa2f958b6e3d77d8b571ff9cab593c08f4373f63ec)

To change your plan, click on the Settings (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right of Sudowrite. Then just select Manage membership, and you’ll be presented with the plan options available to you.

(_Heads up: Legacy plan members switching plans will forfeit their legacy status and any associated bonuses!_)

### Is there a free trial?

**ID:** 6391080
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:06:54.196Z

Yes! You can get started with a free trial, after which you will need an active plan to use any of Sudowrite’s features. The free trial is not time-limited—you’re free to tinker and experiment with Sudowrite’s features until you exhaust the 10,000 trial credits included.

Oh, and don’t worry—you’ll always be able to access and export your documents, even without an active plan!

### What plans are available?

Sudowrite offers three subscription tiers—so whether you’re a hobbyist or a working professional, there’s an appropriate option for you. All plans have full access to _all_ of Sudowrite’s features. The difference between them is simply the number of credits included each month, and whether or not those credits expire.

The plans are:

-   **Hobby & Student:** 225,000 credits - Price: $10/mo (paid annually) or $19/mo (paid monthly)
    
-   **Professional:** 1,000,000 credits - Price: $22/mo (paid annually) or $29/mo (paid monthly)
    
-   **Max:** 2,000,000 _rollover_ credits - Price: $44/mo (paid annually) or $59/mo (paid monthly)
    

As outlined above, discounts are available to those who opt to subscribe annually rather than a monthly.

### Which plan should I get?

**Collection:** Plans And Account > Sudowrite Plans
**Slug:** 4733320-which-plan-should-i-get
**ID:** 4733320
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T16:04:35.724Z

Which plan you should choose **depends** entirely on your writing habits and goals. While we can’t tell you outright which plan is best for you without knowing that, we can share some things you should consider:

First, **credits don't map to words 1:1**—that is, some Sudowrite features generate a lot of words for a few credits, and other features are more credits intensive. For example, using the Write button or Describe (especially with efficient AI models) uses very few credits. Meanwhile, filling up your Story Bible and then asking Sudowrite to generate your full chapter’s prose could consume quite a few credits.

So given that, you should consider:

-   **What are you writing goals?** Do you want to write a short story or a novel? And do you want to write it in one month, or over three months?
    
-   **How much AI support do you expect to use?** Will you be using the AI features sometimes, or do you want the AI to do a lot of heavy lifting—generating chapter prose for you, for example?
    
-   **Will you mostly be using chat?** Sudowrite plans all include access to Quick Edit and Chat, which are story-aware features _included_ with your plan. That is, these features do not consume credits by default (though they do both have a High Quality mode available which will).
    

If you think you’ll _mostly_ use chat in combination with our Quick Edit feature, then a Hobby & Student plan is probably fine—you’ll barely use any credits with those. On the other hand, if your goal is to write a novel in 30 days, you probably want at least a Professional plan since it will allow you to get a lot of AI support from Story Bible.

There’s no single right answer here. Fortunately, we make it _very_ easy to upgrade, downgrade, take a break, try it again, or cancel forever—so you don’t need to sweat it too much.

If you want some help picking, join our community Discord server at: [https://discord.gg/sudowrite](https://discord.gg/sudowrite)

Logging into Sudowrite

For security purposes, we do not currently authenticate accounts with passwords. Instead, we use passwordless authentication, which is accomplished via an emailed link. It means only the holder of the email account will ever be able to access your Sudowrite account.

We do, however, support other methods like logging in via Google! If you like, you can click "Log in with Google" via the login screen, and this will allow you to enter the site without checking your email for the magic link.

# Brainstorm

Sometimes you have a good idea of what you need—a new setting for your fantasy epic perhaps—but are tapped out on creative names or fresh angles. That’s where Brainstorm comes in. With Brainstorm, you bring the seed of an idea and get rapid-fire inspiration in the form of a list.

To get started, click the Brainstorm button, and choose from:

-   Dialogue
    
-   Characters
    
-   World building
    
-   Plot points
    

-   Names
    
-   Places
    
-   Objects
    
-   Descriptions
    

-   Article ideas
    
-   Tweets
    
-   Something else
    

Then enter your seed. Maybe it’s “Names and descriptions of spaceships.”

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a8875ca99492c59ba6a/0198aeb8-7e1b-7b40-bab8-d20496184d23/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjgtN2NhNS03MmYwLWI5MDItZDc0ZDNiNWZmMGM1.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=3482dacedf369a29c0390a0050551cfefb8fe33dea4e61064f1389e5c2e39545)

Click Start and you’ll have a fresh list of spaceship concepts generated for you. You can use the Thumbs Up (👍) to save the ones you like to your Keepers List, and the Thumbs Down (👎) to clear that suggestion from your list (to make space for a new one). When you’re satisfied with your choices, click Save & Exit, and your Keepers List will be saved to a card in your History panel on the right.

**Brainstorm transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Brainstorm video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome to the next installment in our Quick Start series. Today, we're exploring the Brainstorm button—a tool designed to get you unstuck and fuel your creativity.

Sometimes, you're on the brink of a great idea but need a spark to ignite it. Whether you're dreaming up a new setting for your fantasy saga or searching for the perfect name for your protagonist, Brainstorm can be your creative partner in that process.

Getting started is simple:

Click on the Brainstorm button to unveil a variety of brainstorming categories, including Dialogue, Characters, World Building, Names, and more. Select the category that fits your current need.

Next, input your seed idea. For instance, if you're looking for "Names and descriptions of spaceships," to fill the infinite void of space in your Sci-Fi novel, just type that in.

Hit Start, and like magic, you're presented with a list of inspired suggestions. Found something you love? Give it a Thumbs Up to add it to your Keepers List. Not quite right? A Thumbs Down clears the way for new ideas.

Once you've curated a collection of ideas that spark joy, click Save & Exit. Your Keepers List is then neatly stored in a card within your document’s History panel, ready for you to revisit and incorporate into your masterpiece.

Here’s a little secret about brainstorm—no matter which category you select, the tool functions identically. You’re essentially choosing from pre-populated suggestions and reference material that will help the AI generations along. You can use this little refresh button for fresh suggestions, and you can always use Something Else to start entirely from scratch.

In closing, the Brainstorm button isn’t just a feature… it’s a creative partner standing by to jumpstart your imagination.

There is actually one other way you may go about brainstorming on Sudowrite… but we’ll cover that next time, when we look at the editor’s Selection Menu and Quick Tools.

### Canvas

# Canvas

If you’re the type of author that works visually—say using index cards to map out an outline—you may want to use Sudowrite’s Canvas feature. Think of Canvas as a flexible digital whiteboard where you can drop notes, draft outlines, and freely rearrange everything in a 2D space.

To access Canvas, click the Canvas button in the lower left portion of your project’s left bar. Doing so will bring you into a fresh Canvas, where you’ll see the orientation information represented in the screenshot below. You can click and drag to select these cards in order to delete them all at once, or select something and delete it individually.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6abf75ca99492c5a3dbe/0198aeb9-3b12-73fd-b5d7-7181810fb823/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjktMzg2Ny03MDFkLWEwMmEtNGY3MjY0OThjMWIx.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=50a4b73265efb047aefbd49b006e56a2d897f6d8c6ddc082bb254ca9b819e34f)

The menu at the bottom of Canvas allows you to add a card, add text, or add an outline.

**Adding a card** gives you a blank card, where you can type anything you’d like to keep track of: some character information, some notes on a scene, or freeform ideas you don’t want to forget.

**Adding text** lets you throw text directly onto the Canvas, which is helpful when you want to label a cluster of cards or otherwise leave annotations for yourself.

**Adding an outline** will place a complete outline directly onto your canvas—represented as a series of linked cards. The outline types available in canvas are The Hero’s Journey, Hollywood Beats, Story Circle, and Romance Outline. Each outline is represented with distinct visuals.

Canvas outlines are a bit different from those in Story Bible. In Canvas you can generate a full outline from your idea, whether it’s a single sentence or several paragraphs. You can also use the three dot (•••) menu to copy that outline to your clipboard if you want to bring it back into a Sudowrite document or even your Story Bible.

**Canvas keyboard shortcuts** include:

`⌘ A` – Select all

`Del` – Deletes a card

`Space + Click + Drag` – Pan the canvas

`⌘ Z` – Undo

`⌘ + SHIFT + Z` – Redo

`⌘ +` – Zoom in

`⌘ -` – Zoom out

`⌘ \` – Reset to center

`⌘ 0` – Reset zoom

### Chat

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 6204120-chat
**ID:** 6204120
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

### Chat

There’s a new chat in town, and it lives in your project’s right bar. To use it, simply toggle your right bar from History (which is where all your “cards” are generated and stored) to Chat.

You never have to brief Chat, or bring it up to speed, because it can see your entire Story Bible and documents. You can ask it basically anything about your characters or story—just highlight a particular section of text if you want it to focus on that.

It’s also a _chat_, which means you can use it for feedback, brainstorming, and other questions—sort of like ChatGPT, only better because it’s unfiltered and it’s built right into Sudowrite. Did we mention Chat is free to Sudowrite subscribers by default?

### How does chat work?

Chat is **story aware**, which means it can see your existing work in order to be as helpful as possible.

Specifically, when your Story Bible is active, **Chat can see your Genre, Synopsis, Characters, Worldbuilding, and Outline**. It also sees **the full text of the current document**, and it will focus on anything that you **highlight** in that document (while still seeing the full doc).

Want to direct Chat’s attention to something or someone in particular? **Chat supports @ mentions** that can provide additional context. You can tag a specific Character or Worldbuilding element by using the @ tag. You can even use the @ tag to reference another document in the same project—for example, if you wanted Chat’s help comparing versions of a chapter, or creating an interstitial chapter.

### Are there limits?

You can have as many chats as you’d like, and you'll find prior conversations when clicking the little folder icon in the upper right. You can create a new chat thread by clicking the plus (**+**) sign.

Note that chats are project-specific, which means Chat can’t see documents in a different project—and you can’t access chats that you’ve had in another project.

While Chat is free by default, you also have the option of enabling the High Quality mode. Chat’s High Quality mode uses a smarter AI model, capable of more logically demanding tasks, and it does use credits. Toggle off High Quality to return to the standard free Chat.

### Describe

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 5156739-describe
**ID:** 5156739
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

# Describe

Feeling stuck on the details? Describe is a way to very quickly get inspired with some super detailed descriptions of… whatever it is you highlighted. Describe will provide responses broken out by the five senses (Sight, Sound, Touch, Taste, and Smell) as well as a couple of metaphors. Like other features, you’ll find the results in the History column on the right.

To use it, highlight a specific word or phrase and click Describe. It often works best when highlighting a short-to-medium length phrase within a paragraph. But it can also work at the paragraph level if you’d like descriptions for a broader set of objects in your scene. Writing a Young Adult novel set in a High School? You might not be thinking about how the smells from the gymnasium intrude on your hallway scenes, but Describe will.

Maybe after that you don’t ever want to know what something smells like. In that case, click the 🔽 toggle on the Describe button to select the senses you’d like Describe to respond with when you use it. Turn as many on or off as you like.

_Note: Describe looks at the paragraph where the highlighted phrase resides, as well as up to 200 words prior to the selection._

**Describe transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Describe video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome back to our Quick Start series. Today we're exploring the Describe button, a tool that can add depth and detail to your writing with ease.

Sometimes as writers we know the impression we’re trying to create, but we have a difficult time finding the exact words for it. The Describe button provides instant suggestions for sensory descriptions and metaphors for anything we’ve highlighted.

To see what I mean, just click the dropdown arrow to the right of the Describe button. When you do, you’re presented with a list of toggles—one for each of the senses that Describe can output. You can certainly leave them all toggled on, but you can also toggle off the options you know you won’t use. Say your young adult novel has a scene in a locker room—you could go ahead and toggle off smell, for example. Doing so will prevent the AI from generating that sensory detail until you toggle it back on—and it will save you a few credits in the process.

Once you’ve identified a section of your text you’d like enhance with some sensory detail, highlight it and press the Describe button—either from the Selection Menu or the Toolbar. A card will be created in the History column on the right for each of the enabled senses. So you can see here that we have sight, touch, taste, and so on.

Now since Describe works a bit differently than either Write or Rewrite, you probably won’t use the card’s Insert button to insert the entire text of a card. Instead, you can simply highlight what works for you, and then Copy and Paste whatever you like into the body of your document.

As with all cards, you can also Star any of these descriptions to refer back to later.

One final note on Describe. Like the other tools we’ve mentioned, Describe only works on selections made within your document’s editor. That means—as of right now—you’re not able to use the Describe button on something in your Story Bible fields. Not directly, anyway, since you could simply copy paste the thing you’re trying to get descriptions of into your editor before clicking Describe. Just be aware that if you get this error, that’s why.

That about covers it for Describe. Let us know what questions you have in the comments, and join us next time when we look at Brainstorm.

### Expand

**ID:** 3974925
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

# Expand

When you have a scene you know would benefit from some added detail, you can use the **Expand** tool. Expand takes the passage you’ve highlighted and draws that out, adding substance and color as organically as possible. Practically speaking, it can turn one sentence into several.

For example, if you were to highlight “Michael got out of bed and made himself breakfast” and use Expand, you might get back a card that suggests, “Michael swung his legs over the side of the bed, and stepped onto the cozy wool rug. He walked to the kitchen, where he moved through his morning routine like a robot, reaching for the market sourdough loaf and loading two thick slices into the toaster. He opened the fridge. His eyes scanned the shelves, and locked in on the blueberry jam. Behind him, the toaster popped prematurely, ejecting the underdone bread to the counter.”

To use it, highlight a sentence or paragraph and choose Expand from the Selection Menu that appears. **Expand requires at least 3 three words be highlighted, and can be used on up to 1,000 words at a time.**

_Note: Expand is focused on the highlighted selection, but will read prose in your document that both precedes and follows that selection._

### First Draft

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 0327513-first-draft
**ID:** 0327513
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

First Draft is a feature that helps you get the ball rolling when you don’t know where to begin. Whether you’re working on a novel, blog post, article, or essay, First Draft will generate up to **3000 words** based on a prompt you provide—giving you a solid jumping-off point to work from.

It’s intended for that early, idea-spark moment, before you’ve written anything in the document. First Draft offers a substantial foundation you can then edit, refine, or build on.

## How to use First Draft

**First Draft only appears when your document is completely empty.** Here’s how to find it:

1.  **Open a blank document** inside any Sudowrite project.
    
2.  Click on the **Plugins** dropdown in the toolbar.
    
3.  Select **First Draft** from the list.
    

You’ll see a field appear with some example prompts to inspire you below. Just complete that field and click Go!

> **ICYMI:** First Draft only appears in totally blank documents. You won’t find it in the Plugins menu if you’re working in a document you’ve already written in.

### For best results from First Draft

The more detail you provide, the better the draft will be. Here are a few tips:

-   **Fiction?** Include character names, settings, and key events.
    
-   **Non-fiction?** Share the structure or argument you want to make.
    
-   **Something else?** Mention tone, style, or any specific quirks you’d like to see.
    

We recommend giving as much detail as you can here. A sentence or two is fine, but a full paragraph is better. As you type, First Draft gives you feedback on how to improve your prompt—think of it as a writing coach guiding you toward a stronger start.

## What you can expect from First Draft

Once you submit your prompt, Sudowrite will stream a first draft directly into the editor. The draft is:

-   Tailored to the type of content you asked for (fiction or non-fiction)
    
-   Inserted as regular text, ready for immediate editing
    
-   Generated with beautiful sparkles—so you can follow along as it appears!
    

Whether it’s a moody short story opening or a structured blog article, First Draft gives you something real to react to.

## When you should use it

First Draft is perfect if you:

-   Don’t know how to start your story or essay
    
-   Want a quick spark of inspiration
    
-   Prefer editing and shaping over generating from scratch
    
-   Need to experiment with tone, structure, or POV without starting from zero
    

Some common use cases include:

-   Fiction scenes and character intros
    
-   Personal essays or blog entries
    
-   Opinion pieces or structured arguments
    
-   Genre-specific prompts like thrillers, romance, or historical fiction

### My Voice (Beta)

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 1042041-my-voice-beta
**ID:** 1042041
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

Ever wish it was easier to make prose sound more like _you_?

**My Voice lets you train a private, custom model on your work so that Sudowrite can instantly rewrite anything in your voice.** It works like magic, whether what you’re transforming was originally written by the AI or a human writing partner.

✌️ There are two simple steps to using My Voice.

1.  Train a custom My Voice on some existing work.
    
2.  Use that My Voice model to restyle prose.
    

## What you’ll need to create a My Voice model

-   **Existing work:** Have a **sample of your own, human-written text** ready to go. It should be representative of the style you’re looking to replicate.
    
-   **Sample criteria:** Minimum of **1,000 words** with no upper limit. The sample _quality_ is the most important consideration.
    
-   **File types:** Upload a `.txt` file **or** just copy/paste text directly into the modal.
    

⚠️ **Important note**

Avoid using AI-generated text as your training data; it can reduce the quality of the resulting model.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b8fb7a5382a87e11257/0198f1a0-def8-7b08-a8a4-d32d6a2d96f6/b64u-MDE5OGYxYTAtZGU0Yi03ZDgxLTkzYTQtMzU2NGIxMmFmNTcx.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=235aa540c648126fa6aaba308f01d56061f42c97e8e8696e04d12ec3f3bce2e6)

## How to train your My Voice model

1.  Head to Sudowrite and **open any document.**
    
2.  In the bottom of the left sidebar, click **My Voice**—or [just click right here](https://editor.sudowrite.com/app/my-voice).
    
3.  Click **Train New My Voice**.
    
4.  Choose one:
    
    -   **Upload** a `.txt` file, or
        
    -   **Paste** your sample into the text box.
        
5.  Click **Start training**. Training typically takes less than **2 minutes**.
    
6.  When training finishes, you’re returned to the My Voice model list, where your new voice appears.
    
    -   By default, it’s named after your file (or the first part of pasted text).
        
    
    -   To rename it, open the **More (⋯) menu** next to the model and choose **Rename**. This is also where you’ll delete a voice.
        

## Use your voice to revise text

Think of My Voice primarily as an **editing** tool that helps you take a first draft to second, third, and beyond.

1.  **Open your project** and highlight the text you want to transform.
    
    -   You can select **short snippets** or **large sections** (up to **4,000 words**).
        
2.  Select **My Voice** in the Selection Menu that appears to rewrite the highlighted prose in the selected style.
    
    1.  Alternatively, click the down arrow (⌄) next to **My Voice** and choose your preferred model (e.g., _Regency style_). Your most-recently selected model will persist.
        
3.  A card will appear in the History section on the right with your rewritten prose.
    
    ![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b8fb7a5382a87e11257/0198f1a1-22a8-71c1-9f02-10b94c76b694/b64u-MDE5OGYxYTEtMjBjOS03YzliLTg2ZGItYmZlYWE4ZDdlOTM1.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7feea49f2e10c1e04d48d2ce56ce50e752596318115e8dd135935495aaa3fc82)

## Controlling the My Voice intensity

You may find that the first time you use My Voice to rewrite a passage, the style is either too subtle or too pronounced for your liking. Fortunately, you can easily change the intensity of a My Voice rewrite. To do so, simply tweak the **Creativity** slider in your **Write Settings**. (You can find the Write Settings beneath the down arrow next to the Write button in the top toolbar.)

-   **Lower Creativity** → lighter edits, less apparent style, closer to the source.
    
-   **Higher Creativity** → stronger more pronounced rewrites with more stylistic change.
    

**Recommended workflow:** Start near the middle, then adjust up or down based on your preference.

☝️ **Tips & best practices**

-   **Match POV & tense:** Train with samples in the **same point of view and tense** as your target work for most predictable results.
    

-   **Selection length ↔ style strength:**
    
    -   On **short selections**, **high** Creativity may cause the model to **expand** more than you want. If it overwrites or “keeps going,” **lower** your Creativity.
        
    
    -   On **long selections** (approaching 4,000 words), you may need to **raise** Creativity to see sufficient stylistic impact.
        

-   **Iterate to intensify style:** For extra impact, copy the rewritten prose from your My Voice card in the History section, paste it back into your draft, and **run My Voice on it again** for a second pass.
    

## What else to know

-   My Voices are stored privately in your Sudowrite account, accessible only to you. **They are not project-specific**, however, which means you can use any My Voice you train in any of your projects.
    

## Troubleshooting

-   **“It didn’t change much.”**
    
    -   Increase **Creativity** or select a longer passage. Ensure your training sample is strong and representative.
        
-   **“It changed too much / kept writing past my selection.”**
    
    -   Lower **Creativity** and select a slightly longer span for more context.
        
-   **“Results feel off.”**
    
    -   Check that your training sample matches your project’s **POV and tense**, and avoid AI-generated training text.

### Prose Modes & Models

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 2549305-prose-modes-and-models
**ID:** 2549305
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

Sudowrite allows you to select from a wide range of Prose Modes and AI models. Choosing different models effectively changes the AI performing the work, impacting output style, creativity, precision, and credit usage.

### What are Prose Modes?

Prose Modes are carefully curated model suites designed specifically for fiction writing, each featuring a primary AI model enhanced by supportive configurations for optimal performance. You can use Sudowrite without ever toggling your Prose Mode, but experimenting with different modes allows you to discover variations in output. Prose Modes can be selected in both your Write settings and the Draft tool. (Other features currently do not support switching Prose Modes.)

Selecting a different Prose Mode directly impacts the AI models used, influencing credit usage and the style and content of generated text.

Current Prose Modes include:

-   **Muse** - Sudowrite's flagship fiction model, purpose-built for creative storytelling
    
-   **Excellent** - Powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, balancing creativity with precise instruction-following
    
-   **Basic** - Utilizing GPT-4o Mini, offering economical and efficient drafting
    

Retired, but still usable Prose Modes:

-   **Most Accurate** - Based on GPT-4
    
-   **Balanced** - Based on GPT-4 Turbo
    
-   **Unfiltered** - Based on Goliath 120B
    
-   **Best Prose (v2)** - Based on Claude 3 Opus
    
-   **Best Prose (v1)** - Based on Claude 2.0
    
-   **Fastest** - Based on GPT-3.5 Turbo
    

### What are Experimental models?

In addition to Prose Modes, Sudowrite offers a variety of specific AI models accessible via Write settings and the Draft tool. These Experimental models have not been extensively optimized for specific writing styles or tasks but offer granular control for specialized scenarios.

Experimental models currently include:

-   **GPT-4.1** (Full, Mini, Nano)
    
-   **GPT-4o** (Full, Mini)
    
-   **Claude 3 Opus**
    
-   **Claude 3 Sonnet**
    
-   **Claude 3 Haiku**
    
-   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
    
-   **DeepSeek V3**
    
-   **DeepSeek R1**
    
-   **Goliath 120B**
    
-   **Mythomax 13B**
    
-   **Mistral Medium**
    
-   **Mixtral 7B Instruct**
    
-   **Mistral 7B Open Orca**
    
-   **Mistral OpenHermes 7B**
    
-   **Gemini Pro**
    

Each AI model offers unique strengths, voices, and capabilities. We encourage authors to experiment broadly to identify the AI that best aligns with their individual writing needs and creative goals.

### So are the Experimental models “raw” models?

Sort of. Keep in mind that Sudowrite has background prompting powering its features, and background functions (such as Saliency Engine) may influence what is ultimately seen by those models. Think of it like this:

Prose Modes = Optimized, Experimental Models = Raw\*, Plugins = Raw

The only ways to use a truly “raw” AI model on Sudowrite is to build an Advanced Plugin using that model. Elsewhere we are doing some (or a lot!) of work to make sure things work great.

Not sure which Prose Mode or AI model is best for your needs? We have a handy breakdown available here:

### Quick Edit

**Slug:** 7484270-quick-edit
**ID:** 7484270
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

### Quick Edit

**Quick Edit** is the fastest way to make light edits to your document, and it’s one of the only tools that works right inside your document (rather than creating a card in the History section).

Find Quick Edit in the Selection Menu, or open it with the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + K** (PC) or **⌘ + K** (Mac).

Quick Edit is included with your Sudowrite plan, and **free to use** by default. You do have the option of toggling on a High Quality mode that _will_ use credits. While High Quality mode is capable of more complex tasks, we’ve found it’s also rarely _necessary_.

### How Quick Edit Works

When you already know that _something_ needs to change, and you just need a little help _doing it_, Quick Edit takes your instructions and makes those changes for you. Just highlight a sentence, paragraph, or entire scene—up to 1,000 words—and tell Quick Edit what you’d like changed or rewritten.

Quick Edit takes your instruction and goes to work, leaving a struck-through version of your original copy in place for comparison. Accept the changes, reject them, or further refine it—all inline.

Quick Edit is available now—find it in the hover menu that opens when you highlight something in your document, or just press Ctrl/Command+K.

### What does Quick Edit know about my story?

One of the biggest benefits of Quick Edit is that **it is story aware**. That means it can see your existing work and the contents of Story Bible in order to stay on track.

Quick Edit will focus on the highlighted text you’d like transformed, but it will also take into account your Genre, Style, Synopsis, Worldbuilding elements, and other context-dependent things like matching Characters or a Chapter Outline.

# Rewrite

Sometimes you dig the idea you’ve got down, but it’d be helpful to see a few alternative ways to phrase it. Other times, you know you need to be more succinct, more upbeat, or more descriptive. Rewrite can help with all of these!

To use Rewrite: Highlight some text—up to 6,000 words at once—and click “Rewrite”! A Rewrite card with a drop-down menu will appear in the History column (on the right), and you’ll be able to select your desired rewrite style from these pre-set options:

-   **Rephrase:** Rewrite the passage in a different way while retaining the meaning.
    
-   **Shorter:** Rewrite the passage to be more succinct.
    
-   **More descriptive:** Adds more telling details to the passage. Similar to the Describe tool, but the AI will make its own decision on which elements to flesh out and incorporate.
    
-   **Show, Not Tell:** Improves the level of detail and adds in more action.
    
-   **More Inner Conflict:** Add more internal conflict and introspection. Works best when the passage selected is a close POV.
    
-   **More Intense:** Allows the AI to amp things up, improving the level of detail and pacing to create a more vivid reading experience.
    
-   **Customize…:** If you select Customize, you can prompt the Rewrite command with any sort of rewrite approach you’d like. It’s a super open-ended tool, and there are practically unlimited ways to use it. Here are some that our users have found helpful:
    
    -   "be more ominous"
        
    -   “be more like Stephen King wrote it”
        
    -   "be set in a cyberpunk future"
        
    -   “add more dialogue”

Note that longer rewrites, such as when you’ve selected a full chapter of prose, can take a minute to process.

**Rewrite transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Rewrite video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome to the next video in our Quick Start series. Today, we're diving into the Rewrite button—a powerful feature designed to refine and enhance your existing text.

When you're happy with the substance of something you’ve written, but get the feeling the prose could use another pass—whether for clarity, style, or just a fresh take—Rewrite can do that for you with the click of a button.

Here's how it works: First, select the text you want to revise, up to 6000 words for Rewrite. Then select the Rewrite button—either from the Selection Menu or the toolbar. You'll see a selector appear in the History column on the right. This is where you’ll choose how you want Rewrite to modify your work—rephrased, shorter, more show/not tell, or even something custom. So you could say “be more quirky” here, or “make this really dark and foreboding.” For now, we’ll use Rephrase.

When I say Go, Rewrite gets to work, and we see new cards appear in that History column. Once your results are ready, you’ll see the updated prose here—and you’ll notice that anything Sudowrite’s AI changed is presented in purple. If you like what you see, just click insert, and it will replace your highlighted selection

You have one additional control with Rewrite, and that’s how many cards it will generate at once. Just click the drop down arrow to the right of the Rewrite button to set your preference—then each concurrent use of Rewrite will output that many card options in the future.

Something to be aware of is that, as of right now, the Rewrite button does not take Story Bible or other story context into account when you use it. Rewrite is focused exclusively on your selection and preferred Rewrite style.

That covers it for Rewrite. Drop your questions in the comments, and stay tuned for the next video in our Quick Start Series focused on the Describe button.

### Selection Menu

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 8443420-selection-menu
**ID:** 8443420
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

# Selection Menu

One of the most powerful tools on Sudowrite is hidden until you highlight something—and it’s called the Selection Menu.

This smart menu will appear, hovering over your document, once you’ve selected text. It will change based on what exactly you’ve highlighted. For example, highlight a _single_ word and you’ll have the option to use Describe, open Quick Edit, or select from Related Words. Meanwhile, choose a longer selection of text and you’ll get options such as Rewrite, Expand, or Visualize as well.

In some cases the Selection Menu is a quicker and easier way to access the toolbar tools—like Rewrite or Describe. But in other cases, the Selection Menu is the primary (or exclusive) way to access a feature. The features that are primarily accessed via the Selection Menu are:

**Related Words** - This feature is a smart thesaurus. A handful of related words will appear in the Selection Menu when you’ve selected a single word, but you also have the option to expand and view a full Related Words word cloud.

**Expand** - Take a selection of text and make it longer and more detailed.

**Visualize** - Visualize can be used to generate an image from a passage of text.

**Quick Edit** - Quick Edit allows you to make fast, custom inline edits in your document. Quick Edit is available by a keyboard shortcut, but it will also always appear as an option in the Selection Menu—whether you’re selecting a single word or an extended passage.

📓 **Selection Menu partial transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a partial transcript specific to the Selection Menu is available by expanding this toggle.

Welcome back to our Quick Start series. Today, we'll be diving in on Sudowrite’s Selection Menu and Quick Tools.

Did you know there are a few secret features on Sudowrite? They’re not really secret, but they are sort of hidden in plain sight. They live in what we call the Selection Menu. The Selection Menu appears when you’ve highlighted a selection of text.

It’s actually a pretty smart menu—it will only ever be populated with options that are appropriate for the text that you’ve highlighted. Here’s what I mean: Highlight a single word, and you’ll see a few alternatives that you might find in a Thesaurus. Click on 15 More, and you’ll open a panel that we call Related Words, with even more suggestions available. You can select another word—either directly from the Selection Menu or from Related Words here—for a quick inline replacement.

With a single word selected, you also have the option to either Describe or Quick Edit. We’ve already reviewed the Describe function, and I’m sure you can imagine how getting some sensory details might be applicable to a single word. We’ll look at Quick Edit in just a moment—

But first… notice how when you highlight a full paragraph, the Selection Menu changes. Joining Describe and Quick Edit are Rewrite—which we’ve already covered—Expand, and Visualize.

Clicking Visualize will generate an image inspired by your selected prose. Just like all of Sudowrite’s other AI features, the results of Visualize will show up in a card in the History column on the right.

Meanwhile, Expand will take a selection of text and make it longer while adding some new details. As you can see with my selection here, I had a very brief paragraph where someone left the orchard for home, and after Expanding this it has slowed the action into a more methodical and detailed journey.

### Series Support

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 1251175-series-support
**ID:** 1251175
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

Whether you currently write a book series or you aspire to, you can take advantage of **Series** support in Sudowrite to share important information between projects. Projects created or moved into a **Series Folder** will share Characters, Worldbuilding, and Outline visibility so that your books’ shared universe, character arcs, and plot lines remain consistent.

## Create a Series

Create a new Series in Sudowrite by clicking the **\+ New** button in the upper lefthand corner of the homepage and selecting **Series** from the dropdown menu. This will create a project folder with a special Series icon and label. Name it as you would with any other folder.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-d0c6-722e-a953-d2dc6f69dc06/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItY2VmNi03ZDU2LWFjYTctNmI0ZDhhNGY0MzJk.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=df9cd3c37eb18800ab6e65f194dafaea284ba7a211f330685792bef39be04601)

Series folders can be created either on the main homepage or within another folder.

> Series will only share Story Bible data between projects in the same hierarchy—meaning if you create a sub-folder inside of a Series folder with additional projects, the data from those projects will not be visible to the projects one level up in the primary Series folder.

## How Series Works

### Characters and Worldbuilding

**Projects within a Series share Characters and Worldbuilding elements.** That means that if I create characters Jane, John, and Jerry in Book 1, I’ll still be able to see and edit those characters in Book 2. Further, changes made to Characters and Worldbuilding elements will be reflected across all books in that Series Folder. This is not just for your reference either; Sudowrite’s AI also has access to all of your Characters and Worldbuilding elements in a Series. Plus, it will remember (and show you!) which book your characters were originally created in.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-cf01-7e72-b249-44176c868622/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItY2U3MC03YzIyLWJlNzktODhlNDI3N2YxZDdi.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4ab4fad599cac60f034f6c0c334ad2af6037051a465080290821e2435e23fc62)

**Best Practices**

Because Sudowrite’s AI has access to all of your Characters and Worldbuilding elements in a Series, it’s a good idea to keep them up to date for whichever volume you’re currently working on. For example, if I have a character Liam who is the protagonist of Book 1, but more of a supporting character in Book 2, I can change his type to reflect whichever Book I am working on.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-d085-7cbd-9b4f-5fd8276363d9/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItY2VlNi03ZTZiLWJmN2UtYTA3MjE5ZTMwYzhk.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9fbc2241a93a037649c339cc8d697099476134762bfdc1c5b0beac601d439f55)

If you have characters that only appear in one book, and you don’t want them showing up in others, it may be a good idea to “hide” them from the AI when working on a volume in which they do not play a part. Toggle the eyeball icon that appears when hovering over a Character or Worldbuilding card, and that card is hidden from Sudowrite entirely. (You can always change it back.)

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-d58a-72d8-93de-18e9010d1675/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItZDNkNy03MWFhLWFkZWMtMzdhZjYzYjBmYTMz.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8fbe4f059942e314e39457ab18f6d1af2cd8bae4be2eefafa5d69bc0686dcf92)

For more complex character arcs or development of Worldbuilding elements, it may be beneficial to create multiple versions of a card—one for each book, or at least for dramatic milestones—and simply hide/show the most relevant version as your work progresses across a series. Alternatively, you can have a single canonical character card or worldbuilding element that is shared and used across the series, updating it as you go, or using the visibility settings on individual traits.

### Outlines

Projects in a Series automatically use Sudowrite’s Outline Unlimited. The structured nature of Outline Unlimited allows other projects to have quick access to any outline in the Series folder.

To access Outlines from different projects, use the dropdown menu in the Outline header section of Story Bible to select the outline you wish to view.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-d508-7cf5-98fd-eeb8f56298d7/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItZDNmNS03NTQxLWE4MmMtZjgxZTQ4YzY0ZDJm.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=89ff8117552ceaca3e89b419d1a537fec128407dad6621e2ec7b5db1d05bb3be)

When viewing an Outline from a different project than the currently open project, **you can both make edits and generations with that Outline**. These changes will persist and be reflected in that project’s Outline moving forward.

Note that when viewing an Outline from a different project, you will not be able to link documents in the current project to chapters in that Outline. You may currently only link chapter summaries in the open project’s outline to documents in that project.

## Adding a Project to a Series

Once you have created your Series Folder, there are a couple of ways to add a project to that series.

-   Drag and drop an existing project on the homepage into the Series Folder
    
-   Use the **••• menu** and select **Move to…** to select the Series Folder from a list of available folders, and move it over
    
-   Creating a new Project using the **\+ New** button when you’re inside of a Series Folder will create a blank project that instantly has access to shared Series information
    
-   Importing a project with the **Import** button from within a Series Folder automatically adds that project to the series, and any Characters or Worldbuilding elements that are detected as part of the import process will be shared across the series.
    

When you add an existing project to a Series Folder:

-   All of that projects Characters and Worldbuilding elements are automatically shared with the rest of the projects in that Series Folder.
    
-   Any duplicates are preserved, and added to the shared Characters and Worldbuilding. This allows authors to create different “versions” of Characters/Worldbuilding elements across volumes in their Series.
    
    -   If you do not wish to have different versions, we recommend reviewing your shared Characters and Worldbuilding after adding an existing project and deleting (or hiding from the AI) any duplicates that are superfluous.
        
-   If the project moved into a Series Folder is using Story Bible’s old Outline format—the plain text box version—it will be upgraded into the Outline Unlimited version. (The old version will remain available as a deleted document in your project following this upgrade.)
    
-   All other projects in the same Series Folder will have access to that project’s outline
    
-   Sudowrite will add the project to your **Series Timeline**
    

## Series Timeline

Every Series Folder has a collapsible Series Timeline section at the top. As projects are added to the Series Folder, they will always be added to the “end” of the Series Timeline. (You can always grab the little handles beside the project title to drag it into its proper sequence.) Sudowrite uses this sequence information to assemble a timeline based on your project outlines, which will be used in subsequent generations inside of the series.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-d53c-7fc5-bc13-b2c784f6764b/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItZDNjNy03ODE5LThjNjUtMGI1YTZhNzc4Yzgx.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e41be3768b19bd3c766c78ec7d798fb60d0e3c1844cc618a0d9c2585f885d338)

You should only have to set this order once. Sudowrite will remember this order when generating content thereafter.

## Removing a Project from a Series

To remove a project from a Series simply move it out of the Series Folder, using the ••• menu and selecting the Move to… option. Alternatively, just drag the project up to the word Home (or the preferred folder name) in the File Path that appears above the series title.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6b3fa9e01a9ad78c9518/0198aebb-d970-7e1a-b0fa-b257b08dec41/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmItZDhkNi03NzY1LWE1MTItMTVmYmU4ZDNmMzY3.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=95eff87e5cfe086b427239423fe93a1606a4645617aa91fa24699a6e46c249f4)

When a project is removed from a Series, it loses real-time access to the shared Story Bible information… but we want to make sure that you don’t lose any hard work you’ve done, either in that Project or the rest of the series. So removing a project from a series works like this:

-   The project that is removed from the Series gets a copy of all shared Characters and Worldbuilding elements from the Series. Those are now specific to that project however, and changes to them will only be reflected within it.
    
-   The Series retains all of the shared Characters and Worldbuilding elements it had before the project was removed, regardless of whether they originated in the removed project or elsewhere.
    
-   The removed project loses access to Outlines from other books in the Series.
    
-   The series loses access to the Outline of the removed project.
    
-   The removed project will also be removed from the Series Timeline.
    

**Warning!** Because projects retain shared Characters and Worldbuilding elements when removed from a Series, you should avoid moving those projects back into the same Series. **Adding a Project to a series automatically adds all Characters and Worldbuilding elements within that project to the Series without regard for duplicates**—that means moving a project out and back into a Series Folder can create a whole mess of duplicates. Yikes.

### Visualize

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Features
**Slug:** 2540440-visualize
**ID:** 2540440
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:43:17.545Z

## **What is Visualize?**

Visualize is a feature that brings your writing to life by generating images based on your text. Whether you're describing a character, setting a scene, or painting a vivid landscape with your words, Visualize transforms your descriptions into visual representations—giving you a new perspective on your work.

This feature is especially helpful for:

-   Seeing how readers might imagine your descriptions
    
-   Visualizing characters or settings to ensure consistency
    
-   Finding inspiration when you're stuck
    
-   Bridging the gap between written descriptions and visual imagination
    

## How to use Visualize

Visualize appears in the Plugins dropdown menu when you have text selected in your document. Here's how to use it:

1.  Select a passage of text (minimum 10 words) that contains descriptive content
    
2.  Click on the **Plugins** dropdown in the toolbar
    
3.  Select **Visualize** from the list
    
4.  Wait a moment while our AI generates an image based on your selection
    
5.  View the generated image in the right sidebar
    

Once your image appears, you can:

-   Insert it directly into your document
    
-   Save it to your computer
    
-   Favorite it for later reference
    

> **ICYMI:** Visualize only appears when you have text selected. Make sure your selection contains enough descriptive detail (at least 10 words) for the best results.

## For best results from Visualize

The quality of your generated images depends on the detail in your text. Here are some tips:

-   **Be specific:** Include colors, textures, lighting, and other visual details
    
-   **Set the scene:** Describe the environment and atmosphere
    
-   **Focus on the most important elements:** What do you want to stand out?
    
-   **Keep it cohesive:** Conflicting descriptions might result in unusual images
    

For example, instead of:

"A castle on a hill."

Try:

"A gothic stone castle perched on a misty green hill, its dark spires piercing the dawn sky, with stained glass windows glinting in the morning light."

Essentially, use the same descriptive language you’d use when trying to conjure an image in your reader's mind for best results.

## Usage information

-   Each image generation with Visualize uses 2500 credits
    
-   Standard image resolution is 1024x1024 pixels
    
-   Minimum text selection: 10 words
    
-   Maximum text selection: 3000 words
    
-   Like other AI functions, can only be used with an active Sudowrite account
    

## Troubleshooting Visualize

**Can't see the Visualize option?**

-   Make sure you have selected at least 10 words of text
    
-   Verify your subscription is active and you have credits available
    

**Image generation failed?**

-   Try selecting a different passage with more concrete descriptive elements
    
-   Ensure your text doesn't contain inappropriate content that might trigger content filters
    
-   Check your internet connection and try again
    

**Not happy with the result?**

-   Try selecting a more specific portion of your text
    
-   Add more descriptive details to your writing before trying again
    
-   Consider using the Describe feature first to enhance your descriptions

# Write

The Write feature is like the most advanced autocomplete ever. It works like this: Place your cursor at the end of some text, and then click Write. Sudowrite will continue it, picking up right where you left off.

To do this, Write looks back at the preceding text (up to 1000 words) to gather context and pick up the thread. If your Story Bible is turned on (and filled out!) Write will also take into consideration your Style, Genre, Characters, and any linked Chapter Outline. It works best with a minimum of 20 words (not counting the document’s title), so ideally there should always be at least a couple of sentences before the cursor… but the more words you provide, or the further into your document you use it, the better the results. Write will typically output around 150-200 words (but you can tweak that number in your Write settings).

Click the 🔽 toggle to the right of Write to expand the Write menu. There you’ll find three different versions of Write— ✨ Auto, ↔️ Guided, and 🥸 Tone Shift—and the Write settings, which is where you’ll control settings for these features.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/0198aeb7-1821-73a0-b39b-fce896089f7f/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjctMTU5NS03NWE3LWJhOWUtNTBjNTg3NGM3YWRm.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=696ee5960885ba3215756ea047c2393fcb8b33fcf4be0aa081446f8ff5f2b608)

Once you’ve selected which Write mode you’d prefer, click the Write button within the text to use it. The suggestions will appear in the History column on the right. If you see a suggestion you like, click Insert to bring that prose into your document. This text will appear in **purple** until it's been edited by you. You’ll get the best results by regularly editing the purple text to make it your own, and fully incorporate it into your work.

Think of Write as a brainstorming partner. Write or paste a scene or chapter of your own into the Editor, and use Write to send the story off in different directions. You’ll discover ideas and paths that will ultimately help enrich your story.

## ✨ Write - Auto

The Auto mode for Write relies the most on what is already written in the primary writing area, ahead of the cursor. (There is one other way to give it input, in Write Settings in the Key Details box, which is explained in that section.)

Let’s try something, and type the following into the editor:

> Plates of cold food lined the dining room table at 54 Wimbley Avenue. Not a single pea or diced carrot was out of place. Which was odd, because

You’ll notice the last sentence is not finished. This is an advanced writing tip when you are cowriting with AI. By leaving a sentence open, your junior writing partner, Sudowrite, understands to continue the thought from there and keep writing!

Let’s keep the setting on ✨ Auto and click Write.

Sudowrite created 2 cards on the right side. They begin unstacked, so you can read the possible paths available, but if you click on the top (prompt portion) of the card, Sudowrite will collapse them down into a stack.

### Advanced Tool Techniques

## ↔️ Write - Guided

Guided Write will write cards in two different ways. You can turn on Suggestions and Sudowrite will read the words in your document, up to 1,000 from where the cursor is, and suggest three story ideas that could come next in the story.

You also can write your own.

Let’s work with the same prompt as before.

> Plates of cold food lined the dining room table at 54 Wimbley Avenue. Not a single pea or diced carrot was out of place. Which was odd, because

Click on the 🔽 down arrow next to **Write** in the top left corner and Select **Guided**.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/0198aeb7-1e3f-7aa1-81f1-2d50daec5b81/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjctMWJmMy03ZTQxLWE4OWMtM2QzOGQwZWY4MjM4.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=31cc6d51a2a700678b8aeea23d198afa657276f49342f322b48ca6228fea54f5)

The Write button will then instead say Write Guided. Now place your cursor at the end of your text, and click **Write Guided** in the top left corner.

**Guided Write** can offer 3 Suggestions of what could come next in the story. You turn on the Suggestions slider if you want Sudowrite to generate those Suggestions.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/0198aeb7-1e4e-70f4-ac83-34edb962ff62/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjctMWMwMS03MzNiLWEwYWMtNTMyYzgwMTQzODA2.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=278f1af85ec837d5418f22e92da70efc3bec289db82bb621c1d59897f362f72b)

If you click on one of the suggestions, Sudowrite will create the number of cards and approximate lengths you chose in **Write Settings**.

![Guided Write reads up to 1,000 words preceding your cursor to generate three suggestions of what could come next.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/0198aeb7-1f15-7d7e-b09b-1d68c9f6faef/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjctMWMxNS03YWQxLWI4NTYtYzFiNWQxZTAyMGNk.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=fac443d967d5fc5479d02eabde99f93e56c7932d062cdbf4637d6769c412f1ad)

Guided Write reads up to 1,000 words preceding your cursor to generate three suggestions of what could come next.

Here is the prompt for the “Write you own” box in the image below:

> there’s a bright flash, and then a loud, apocalyptic explosion outside

### Getting the most from Write’s Guided mode

In Guided mode, you can write a sentence or two to describe what should come next. Here’s what works best:

-   **Make it Believable** If your suggestion is too out of the blue, Sudowrite may have a hard time figuring out how to write it.
    
    -   Solution: Break your unbelievable idea into smaller, believable ideas. Maybe the detective finds a magic lamp, and then hears something coming from inside.
        
-   **Break up bigger ideas** Your suggestion should be doable in a couple paragraphs.
    
    -   Solution: Break long ideas into small chunks. For example, just start with “The two agree to go on a date”, hit Write, then go again with the next part.
        

**Try this!**

Stop mid sentence.

Guided mode will do a better job sticking to your story if you put the cursor mid-sentence before you click Write. This is because a period indicates to Sudowrite that a new idea should come next.

-   **Keep it simple**
    
    Simple sentences and repetition help Sudowrite understand what you want.
    
    -   Example: "Bill and Sophie get into a fight. After their fight, Sophie leaves." Because these instructions are short and clear, Sudowrite can easily understand that the fight is important, and that this is a sequence of two separate actions.
        

## 🥸 Write - Tone Shift

Tone Shift works a lot like Write’s Auto setting with one key difference—it changes the style of your writing in the process.

After clicking the Write 🔽 toggle, choose Tone Shift and then select from any of the following tones: Ominous, Fantastical, Fast-Paced, Upbeat, Authoritative, Conflicted, Romantic, Sensual. Then just put the cursor where you’d like to pick up the story from, and click the Write button. You’ll see the story continues along the vibes of what you’d selected.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/0198aeb7-23ee-74c3-ae9b-b014b4c50760/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjctMjI3Zi03YmE1LTgxN2QtZTFlMDgzZWE5Mjll.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c843f4394ece9af7292f8a3d8d31743ab4acdac4f18ec9a997a2fdb0cfa74a0c)

## Write Settings

The last button under Write is for the Write Settings, which let you dictate how each Write feature should work.

![Default Write Settings when you start using Sudowrite.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6a0e65f1223af33e0090/0198aeb7-2345-7f00-b10f-95dbcf283103/b64u-MDE5OGFlYjctMjFjZC03MjNiLTgwMjgtMGE4NDQyYWZlYzA4.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d7706f4a33582ae1bf369ec9bc05214aaf6d1765bcaaf39b08810aebecc8a032)

### Creativity

The Creativity slider dictates how strictly the Write feature will stick to what you’ve already written. When the slider is at Least, this gives Sudowrite the least amount of flexibility to deviate from the prior context it read. It doesn’t mean the prose that Sudowrite comes up with is any less creative, instead the writing will just endeavor to match the arc of what is already in the document. Essentially, low creativity on this slider means the content of the response will be more predictable in line with what you’ve already written.

Pushing the slider all the way to Most gives Sudowrite creative agency. Consider this a promotion for your junior writing partner; Sudowrite now has creative license to take your story down much more unexpected paths.

By default the slider is right in the middle. But where should you keep it? That’s up to you and what you need from Sudowrite for your story.

### Number of Cards

This drop down controls how many cards (or variants) are generated in your History column (on the right side) when you use a Write feature. You can set this anywhere from 1 to 5.

### Length of Cards

This drop down allows you to set a rough approximation of how long each individual card should be in a response. It ranges from ~50 words all the way up to ~500 words. Each time Sudowrite generates a card, that’s a new pass at the request on the part of the AI, so the results will vary.

### Key Details

This section only informs Write when it is in ✨ Auto mode. It’s also a setting for the entire Project rather than a Document level setting.Key Details also **does not** affect Canvas or Story Bible.

As you move between documents in your Project, make sure to either turn off Key Details or change the information it contains if its contents do not apply to the scene you’re working on.

Great things to put into Key Details:

-   how you want the prose written such as “romantic” or “foreboding”
    
-   what heat level or intensity you want romance or violence scenes to be written
    
-   what genre are you writing in, keep in mind you might need to define newer genres or abbreviations to Sudowrite like “reverse harem” or “mpreg”
    
-   character names and brief details that are needed for the story, such as “Logan’s right arm was broken ten minutes before this scene happens, he is feeling incredible pain”
    
-   setting details that you want worked in such as “grand English country estate”
    
-   _and anything else you can think of, write in here like you would give notes to a junior writing partner!_
    

📓 **Write transcript**

While the visuals in the video above are _sort of_ essential, a transcript of the Write video above is available by expanding this toggle.

This is the third installment in our Quick Start series, and today we’ll look at the Write button.

The Write button is like the most advanced autocomplete you’ve ever used—it looks at what you’ve written up to wherever the cursor is (as well as a few other things we’ll discuss), and then continues writing for you.

By default the Write button will generate two “cards”—those are the AI suggestions, and they’ll show up in the History column on the right.

If you like one of them, just use the Insert button to pop it into your story. AI-generated words show up in purple like this, until you modify them.

If you don’t want to use it immediately, but like it enough that you may want to refer back to it later, use the star button.

Starred cards show up in this column after toggling from the History clock icon to the Star icon.

You can get pretty far using the stock Write button, which we call Auto, but if you want to try other modes, click this little arrow dropdown to the right of Write.

This opens the Write Menu, where you can customize the way the Write button works—here you’ll see a few additional options, including guided, tone shift, and write settings.

Guided Write gives you a little bit more directional control. You can get at a glance suggestions for continuation paths, or suggest your own—when you see something you like, you can ask for a completion to appear in your History column.

Tone shift works like Auto, but you’re choosing the style of the continuation you’d like to see.

Finally, the Write settings are where you can totally customize the way Write works.

You can change the number of cards generated with each click, and their length,

you can play with this slider to get more or less creative results,

and you can even choose the prose mode—that option determines exactly which AI will be doing the writing. They all have different styles and capabilities. Some are more economical than others when it comes to using credits. We encourage you to experiment and see what works for you.

Key details down here is a way to get the Write button to remember something important. So for example, if your story takes place on Mars, it’d probably be good to jot that down so the AI doesn’t mention bright blue skies. There’s one other place that the Write button can draw context about your story from—and that’s Story Bible. That’s a topic for another day, but just keep in mind that you don’t have to put your full character list in key details, since the Write button will probably be getting that from your Story Bible.

I’d mentioned in the last video that there’s technically a fourth simple way to get started—and that’s using the write button in a totally blank document. Write will write something… basically whatever the AI wants to write… it’s sort of fun as a story starter, but definitely not the most practical.

That pretty much covers the Write button. Let us know what questions you have in the comments, and stay tuned for next time when we discuss Rewrite.

## Plugins

### How do I build Plugins?

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 1671769-how-do-i-build-plugins
**ID:** 1671769
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T01:53:02.748Z

## Creating Plugins

Roll up your sleeves and start making some Plugins of your own—for yourself or everyone on Sudowrite! If you know some basics when it comes to writing prompts for AI, building your first Plugin will be easy.

But before you get started, make sure to set your [profile name to what you want publicly displayed](/ba0fd91005c94f589ea6901070ae8bb8?pvs=25#e086bf5404b849c2b89ab240e488094b). Whatever you set here is what will show up as the Creator Name on Plugins you Publish to the Directory.

To get started, click on the Create Plugin button in the top right corner of the plugins list page to get to the plugin creation flow.

### The Basic Editor

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/0198f175-8a50-7fea-b315-a89ada15d547/b64u-MDE5OGYxNzUtODk5OC03Y2Q1LTliZjAtYWRhODM2Y2ViNzVk.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c3213d120f4b2e829ce4aadbed44d0a6c857ab906671ebaf85dfe856dafe2093)

The Basic Editor is the quickest way to build a Plugin, and you can do so with something as simple as a single prompt.

Here’s what each of the fields pictured above does:

1.  **Name** \- Give your Plugin a unique name. The name should be succinct, and clearly communicate what the Plugin does since this will be the name seen in the dropdown.
    
2.  **Description** - Describe what the Plugin does and include specifics of how to use it. Depending on the Plugin, it may make sense to include an example input and output response.
    
3.  **Visibility** - You can choose to Publish your Plugin or keep it Unlisted. Unlisted plugins do not show up in the Directory or search results, but you can still use them—and anyone with the direct URL would also be able to see/install the Plugin.
    
4.  **Category** - Choose a single option from the options available to categorize your Plugin according to _what it is for_—anything from _Analysis & Feedback_ to _World-Building_. This will determine where the Plugin appears on the Explore page.
    

_The Categories currently available are:_

**Narrative & Plot** - Plugins that focus on creating and/or enhancing the plot.

**Character Development** - Plugins that assist in crafting and refining characters.

**Editing & Revision** - Plugins that improve the writing style and prose.

**Scene Enhancement** - Plugins that help with improving or modifying a scene.

**World-Building** - Plugins that aid in creating immersive and detailed fictional worlds.

**Analysis & Feedback** - Plugins dedicated to providing in-depth evaluations and feedback on written content.

**Marketing** - Plugins designed to aid authors in promoting and distributing their work to a broader audience.

**Genre-Specific** - Plugins that provide guidance and/or prompts tailored to specific genres, such as romance, horror, or young adult fiction.

**Multi-Lingual** - Plugins that help with translation or are narrative tools that are language specific.

5.  **Your Instructions** - This is where you tell the AI exactly what to do. When a user highlights text and then uses your Plugin, the AI will read the text first, and then be prompted with these instructions. Be precise with your instructions, as if it were written for an assistant who cannot ask you follow-up questions while they are doing the task.
    
6.  **Enable Story Bible Data** - If your Plugin could benefit from understanding the user’s Story Bible, enable this and click on the relevant parts of the Story Bible that you’d like to share with the AI. (Maybe the plugin needs to know the genre or style to work optimally—it’s up to you!)
    

> **Good to Know**
> 
> Plugins use **credits**, just like other Sudowrite features, when used. Basic Plugins are generally pretty cost effective, but might get expensive if you decide to pass in the complete contents of someone’s Story Bible.
> 
> Advanced Plugins get way more complex, letting you insert variables where and how you’d like them, toggle between AI models, and even string prompts together in sequence—which means the credit use could vary dramatically.

### Advanced Editor

If you need more control over the prompts, the Advanced Editor gives you precise control over the prompt formatting and various Large Language Model options. You can also create multi-stage prompts (currently up to 2)!

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/0198f175-e857-7597-8eed-43565203174d/b64u-MDE5OGYxNzUtZTc3YS03NGY3LThmMWYtN2QyY2RkNTg0ODcy.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=3602605b102c29e71b3962e9b909e3e41fd6d89f62b99fe850cefd20480d623d)

The Advanced Editor begins to look different from the Basic Editor once you scroll past the visibility and category options.

Here’s what each of the areas in the screenshot above controls:

1.  **Preceding Text** - Preceding Text is a variable representing the words before the cursor. In Basic Plugins this works as a fallback, reading the words before the cursor if the Plugin user had not highlighted anything. If you plan on using `{{ preceding_text }}` then you may want to specify the minimum and/or maximum number of words needed before the cursor for the Plugin to work here.
    
2.  **Highlighted Text** - Highlighted Text is a variable representing the words the user has highlighted—this will be replaced by the exact words the user has highlighted when the Plugin is run, passing that context into the prompt. If you plan on using `{{ highlighted_text }}` you can specify the minimum words required and maximum allowed for a highlight here.
    
3.  **User Text Input** - If you toggle on _Allow Users to Give Instructions_, you also enable the `{{ user_text_input }}` variable. With this feature enabled, your Plugin users will get a popup window before the Plugin is actually run, prompting them for input according to instructions you’ve defined. Inserting this variable in your Plugin instructions is a way to directly pass in end user input.
    
    ![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/0198f177-f932-77b7-8803-4d6762c4035c/b64u-MDE5OGYxNzctZjg3NS03ZDYzLTg0YjAtYzJmM2ViMDk1ZmY0.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=0e9cd28ef48e790b1b372f7ccaf4145691c3080a7a4ba650d0401b049f316103)

**Available Variables** \- In addition to those discussed above (which have their own configurator inside of the Advanced Plugin builder) there are a bunch of additional variables available to enrich your custom Plugins.

{{ previous\_document\_text }} - The text from all previous documents in the chain of previous documents. This takes advantage of a user’s chapter continuity.

{{ braindump }} - The braindump from the story bible.

{{ genre }} - The genre from the user’s story bible.

{{ style }} - The style from the user’s story bible.

{{ synopsis }} - The synopsis from the user’s story bible.

{{ characters }} - The characters from the user’s story bible, optimized by the Saliency engine to only include textually relevant character data.

{{ characters\_raw }} - All of the character data from the story bible, raw, unoptimized.

{{ outline }} - The outline from the story bible.

{{ scene\_summary }} - The section of the outline linked with the current document a plugin is being used within, if any.

{{ is\_story\_bible\_active }} - Information as to whether or not story bible is toggled on.

{{ chapter\_scenes }} - The Scenes from the story bible.

{{ chapter\_scenes\_extra\_instructions }} - The Extra Instructions that a user has opted to include in their Draft box.

{{ worldbuilding }} - The worldbuilding entries from the story bible, optimized by the Saliency engine to only include what is textually relevant.

{{ worldbuilding\_raw }} - The worldbuilding entries from the story bible, raw, unoptimized.

1.  **Prompts -** By default an Advanced Plugin has a simple Prompt area—**Prompt 1**. Inside of that box you can specify the exact instructions and LLM you’d like.
    
    1.  **System** - This specifies how the AI should behave. For instance, a system message could be: "You are a helpful assistant." This instructs the model to behave like a helpful assistant during the chat.
        
    2.  **User** - This is the substance of your plugin. Here, you will combine the user’s `{{ highlighted_text }}` and possibly the Story Bible data into a prompt for the language model to produce the desired functionality for the user. A few guidelines:
        
        -   Give a strong cue as to what part of the prompt is the user’s highlighted text, which will let the AI know what part is coming from the user. Something like:
            
        
        `Here is a passage of text: {{ highlighted_text }} Based on the passage of text provided, [...rest of instructions...]`
        
        -   Be as specific as you can with your instructions. A good approach is to write this as if you’re writing an email to an assistant for them to do the task correctly on the first try without requiring clarifying questions.
            
        -   If prompt rewrites the user’s highlighted text, specify at the end how long the rewrite should be. If it should be rewriting into approximately the same number of words, say so, like `ONLY REWRITE THE PASSAGE, DO NOT MAKE IT LONGER`
            
        -   The genre, style, synopsis, characters, and outline are available as variables as well, allowing you to inject Story Bible data to influence the prompt.
            
    3.  **AI Options** - These options changes the behavior of the language model selected.
        
        -   **Engine** - You can select from several different AI models. We believe `gpt-4o-mini` is sufficient for most tasks—but much more capable (albeit slower and more expensive) models exist, such as `gpt-4.1` and even `gemini-2.5-pro` which is capable of reading entire manuscripts.
            
        -   **Temperature** - Think of this as the "creativity" dial. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the model's responses more random and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes them more focused and deterministic. Ranges from `0` to `1.0`. We recommend `0.85` for most use cases.
            
        -   **Frequency Penalty** - Controls how much the model avoids or prefers frequently used words or phrases. A negative value makes it more likely to use frequent words, while a positive value makes it avoid them. It's like asking a writer to avoid clichés: a positive value tells them to be more original and not use common phrases, while a negative value lets them use those familiar phrases freely.
            
        -   **Presence Penalty** - This adjusts the model's inclination to include new ideas or topics. A positive value encourages it to introduce new concepts, while a negative value makes it stick more closely to the topics already mentioned. Imagine instructing a teacher: a positive value tells them to bring up new topics often, while a negative one tells them to stay on the current topic.
            
        -   **Stop** - This parameter lets you specify words that, when generated by the model, will make it stop generating any further. For instance, if you set "stop" to be ".", the model would stop generating text as soon as it produces a period. It's like giving a speaker a cue: "When you mention this word or symbol, wrap up your speech.”
            
        -   **Number of Generations** \- The number of cards your plugin should generate. Each card is an independent “run” of your plugin, and do not affect each other. Specifying more than one is useful if you want to give the user a diverse set of options to choose from. (Note: multi-stage prompts require this to be 1)
            
        -   **Max Tokens** - This determines the maximum number of tokens the model will produce in its output (where a token is roughly 0.75 words). For example, if you set "max tokens" to 50, the model will not generate a response longer than 50 tokens.
            

2.  **Multi-Stage Prompts** - To create multi-stage prompts—which are essentially two of these in sequence—you can click on the “+ Prompt” button at the bottom, which will create a new prompt. The second stage is exactly the same as the first, except now you have access to a new variable `{{ prompt_1_result }}` which will be the output from the first prompt. This is great if you’d like to run an analysis, and the use that analysis to run an edit or text transformation in the following prompt.
    
    1.  Note that while you will see the prompt 1 result in testing, only the end result of the second prompt will be output to a card in the user’s History when a live Plugin is used. This means users will not see the intermediate prompt results. (In the example above, the end user would not see the analysis, only the transformed text.)
        

**Heads Up** Once you start editing your Plugin in the Advanced Editor, you may not be able to go back to the Basic Editor—especially if you use options that the Basic Editor does not support.

## Testing Plugins

At the bottom of the Plugin creation page, you will see a testing area:

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/0198f17d-7f32-71ce-8b0e-c47e75fb936e/b64u-MDE5OGYxN2QtN2VmMi03YjhjLThkNjctN2NhM2VlYWEzMzkw.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e15a079c174512af1da166b0d79f82cc60c941ace624b669bdb22b9bce9bf68a)

This lets you easily and quickly test your Plugin without publishing it. It’s essential that you test your plugin to make sure it works with a diverse set of inputs—and that you’re getting the results you want out of it. We suggest that you have a bank of inputs along with an idea what your expected output is. This way, as you iterate on the design of your plugin, you can make sure that the functionality matches your expectations.

Toggling Additional Variables exposes fields to populate Preceding Text as well as any Story Bible test data (in case your Plugin makes use of those). Note that we’ve pre-populated some Story Bible context for quick testing, but you can replace that with more tailored inputs for better results. (If you notice your Plugin is talking a lot about Bigfoot in testing, it’s possible you’re passing in this context without realizing it!)

## Profile Name

You can edit what name shows up for your Plugins by clicking on the small “Edit” link in the Settings (⚙️) menu in top right of your Sudowrite interface:

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6f0e94da8fb2bf6c0296/0198f17d-f4a7-7d85-818b-02fe918e4d56/b64u-MDE5OGYxN2QtZjQxOS03ZjdlLWI4NzQtZmFiYjBkZGYzMjBm.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=0f7a3139790f253ec2095e31fc20ff7208023d814cdeff6d72eeab92ca795dd1)

By default, if you’ve logged in via Google, that will be set to your Google display name.

### Example - Summarize Plot Points

## How does the Saliency Engine work with Plugins?

Some plugins are designed to use your Story Bible data. In those cases, Saliency Engine may or may not be used, depending entirely on how the creator built that plugin.

-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters }}` or `{{ worldbuilding }}` variables, the Saliency Engine **will** kick in when necessary.
    
-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters_raw }}` or `{{ worldbuilding_raw }}` variables, the full context of those fields will be passed along into the AI in their entirety. The Saliency Engine will make no attempt to parse the data for relevant context.
    
    -   Note: In most cases, the `raw` version will give the AI _way_ more context. This can either degrade or improve the results, depending on both the plugin configuration and the context passed through as a result… but it will almost always make the Plugin use more credits.
        
    -   **Hidden characters or traits will never be visible to the AI**, even if a Plugin is using the a `raw` variable.
        

> Be Advised: Credit cost is always calculated based on input, output, and the model selected. If a user with hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements uses a Plugin that includes the `raw` version of a variable, a great deal of context will be passed through to the AI. **This could consume a ton of credits!**

All Plugins that predate the Saliency Engine use the standard `{{ characters }}` variable, and so will use Saliency Engine by default.

## Finding Plugins

There are two ways to access the Plugins directory, and find all of the community-created Plugins currently available.

1.  The Directory is linked from the home page:
    
    ![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/0198ec43-dfb2-7bbc-a5ce-f610f1274415/b64u-MDE5OGVjNDMtZGY5NC03NmRhLWE0MTgtNzZjOTNmNWVmNmZl.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ed5e67893e2bcac3c18a40895f8d2a2c71d3da55f6fff0d4cc38737ad3c6de64)

2.  And when you have a Project open, you will find a Plugins option in the main menu:
    
    ![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/0198ec43-f53f-7a63-a46d-a0fea9d09026/b64u-MDE5OGVjNDMtZjRlNi03NDJkLWE2YTgtNjRmZDg2YTJhNWI4.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=75066eee3dc5d7eb437836df244248d67dbda6010694b3b95b678ac93878eb1e)

## Adding Plugins

The Plugins Directory page lists all of the available Plugins.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/0198aec9-5b20-700e-9e18-6a735b18f153/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzktNWEzZi03NDZiLWI2MzItOTFhYzFhNGY4ZmEy.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f87829ac35ac6537ffad7d13e717929b9ee950c4306fd16662d2b992bc10c476)

The Plugins Directory, with featured Plugin cards pictured up top.

You can select Categories along the left to view Plugins according to their category, and you can use the filter views available to sort by Popular (most installed) or Newest (most recently published). Note that you also have filter views available for Plugins you’ve added or built.

To add a plugin, just click “Add” on that Plugin’s baseball card. You can also click into the card to visit the Plugin’s Description page and read more about it.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/0198aec9-5fcb-7382-b6a6-6668b1b36f31/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzktNWViZi03MWU0LTk5ODItNDdlN2Y1NWU2N2Qz.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b4f29df6281952d59e66f84f998a4b8fefcc9451b620fa3e6399bd3fbd353e45)

An example of the Plugin Description page.

The Description page includes details on the creator, how many users it has, an estimation of how many credits it might use, and a Description written by the creator. The Description should give you a good idea of what the Plugin is intended to do, and ideally how to use it.

Some creators may choose to make their Plugin Instructions visible, and if they’ve done so, those will appear on this page as well.

In the upper right, you’ll see a Copy Link button (if you’d like to share the Plugin) and an Add button, which will install it. To use the Plugin, you’ll have to click Add.

Once you’ve added a Plugin, you will see it available in all of your projects under the **Plugins** dropdown in the top right of your toolbar.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6ecb8b51ae828dc18f95/0198aec9-5f10-7676-b04f-33256d403735/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzktNWU4Mi03NmQwLWI5NTEtMTJlMjU5MTQwYzI5.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260121T020000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260121%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=1944026af81dd29ee6574542c35b2ea7adeee9ec80dacaeeea006d032a7b3c6c)

To use a Plugin, just select it from this dropdown. But take note: The Plugins you install may work in one of many different ways. They may require you to highlight text, or put your cursor somewhere in particular. Some Plugins even ask you to structure the text in your document in a particular way, or write specific text (sometimes in a specific format) and highlight _that_. It’s important to familiarize yourself with how a Plugin works (again, on the Description page) before using it in order to achieve the best results.

Plugins output to the History column on the right, just like other Sudowrite features. And just like with those features, you can favorite, insert, and copy these cards as desired.

### Plugins Guidelines

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 5603490-plugins-guidelines
**ID:** 5603490
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T01:53:02.748Z

Plugins unlock custom functionality on Sudowrite, empowering our writer community to build and share totally custom tools. With great power comes great responsibility though, so here are some guidelines as to what we expect from our community when it comes to building and sharing Plugins.

## What Plugins Are For

The Plugins drop-down in your toolbar is like a Swiss Army Knife, only _you_ get to decide the tools you’ll fill it with. You can do so by adding Plugins from the Explore page or by building them yourself.

Generally speaking, **we expect Plugins to enhance or enrich the writing process**. This might mean making it easier, faster, more creative, or more joyful. Plugins may be used for analysis, generation, interpretation, or even to accomplish specialized writing techniques. We don’t want to be overly prescriptive about what you should make though! Our main advice is to reflect on your workflow and get creative.

## Best Practices

Here are a few helpful guidelines to keep in mind as you build:

✅ **Use short, descriptive titles.** The Plugin’s title will show up in the Plugins drop-down, so short and sweet helps the UX.

✅ **Keep Plugin titles and descriptions PG-13.** Use NSFW designations when merited.

✅ **Be clear about the input necessary.** Not everyone will read your Plugin’s full prompt, so try to say how it works in the description. (Ex. “Highlight at least 200 words.”)

✅ **Be clear about the expected output.** Say exactly what a user should expect to get out of using your Plugin—whether that’s an analysis, finished prose, multiple cards, or something else. (Ex. “This Plugin will generate two separate cards of prepared prose.)

✅ **Share what you build!** You’re encouraged to Publish and share the Plugins you’ve built. But also…

❌ **Leave broken Plugins Unlisted.** It can take a little experimentation to get a Plugin working just right. If it’s not working as described or intended, leave it Unlisted until it is.

❌ **Try not to delete Plugins people depend on.** Deleting a Plugin altogether will remove it for everyone who has ever added it. That might break things for others who have come to depend on it, so default to toggling it to Unlisted if necessary.

## Dealbreakers

This part should be obvious, but to keep everyone safe **we don’t allow Plugins that are dangerous, hateful, or illegal**.

You can view the list of prohibited uses here.

**Plugins can not…**

❌ Promote services or products in a spammy or disruptive manner.

❌ Create or distribute harmful/malicious content/software.

❌ Steal or infringe on intellectual property rights.

❌ Promote hate or discrimination.

❌ Do any other stuff that’s illegal or in violation of our Terms of Use.

## Help One Another

As you discover and experiment with Plugins, you may encounter Plugins that don’t work as described. If you’re able to find the creator in Discord, let them know so they have the opportunity to fix it up. Otherwise, you can let us know, and we can toggle it to Unlisted until we can get in touch with them.

Meanwhile, if you find a Plugin that you feel weird about—maybe you’re concerned it’s in violation of our rules above—feel free to drop us a note and we’ll give it a look. Contact us at [hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com) or reach out to our Community Lead, Michael Stewart, on Discord.

## Questions?

Please email [hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com) with your questions or concerns. Alternatively, raise them in the community Discord server!

### What are Plugins?

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Plugins
**Slug:** 0953803-what-are-plugins
**ID:** 0953803
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21T01:53:02.748Z

Sudowrite Plugins allow you to create powerful, custom AI functions for anyone on Sudowrite to use. Here’s a brief video introduction to Plugins.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are custom features, that allow Sudowrite to do cool new things it couldn’t do otherwise. Think of them a little like browser extensions, which expand the capability of your web browser. Your web browser doesn’t necessarily come with an ad blocker, or a password manager, but you can install extensions that do those things.

Plugins work similarly. If there’s ever a tool you need that doesn’t appear to be a feature of Sudowrite, you can find a Plugin, or even build your own custom Plugin, to tackle it. It’s a way to dial in your dream workflow. You may want to share these with the community in our directory, or if they’re super specific to your process you can keep them unlisted while still using them yourself.

## What can Plugins do?

Basically anything an author might want to do… but saying “anything you want” is not very instructive! Instead, it may be helpful to know the three major functions a Plugin might serve:

**Writing** - Plugins can generate text according to your instructions.

**Editing** - Plugins can transform text according to your instructions.

**Analysis** - Plugins can analyze text according to your instructions.

But the thing that makes Plugins super powerful is that they can also do any combination of these things. So maybe you want to analyze a chapter of your work according to a set of rules you have for yourself. A Plugin could do that and generate an analysis for your reference—or you could have it generate the analysis, and then make the edits to the text directly based on that analysis.

Plugins are super flexible!

## Story Bible

### Braindump

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 9784768-braindump
**ID:** 9784768
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

# **Setting up your story**

You can’t bake a cake without ingredients.

In this case, the cake is your novel and the ingredients are your Braindump, Genre, Style, Synopsis, Characters, and Outline. You’re the baker, and Story Bible is like a junior baker helping you out. This is not the best analogy… we probably should have asked Sudowrite for help.

In any event, for each of these “ingredients,” Story Bible can make suggestions or you can do it yourself. Let’s walk through how it works. No more (bad) analogies, promise.

## Braindump

Imagine that you’re meeting with another writer who will collaborate with you on your story. You’re meeting them for the first time, and they have zero context. The Braindump section is what you’d tell this writer in order to introduce them to the core elements on your story.

This could be a sentence, a paragraph, a snippet of a scene, or any free-form passage of text. The more information you put in Braindump, the better the AI will understand your vision.

**We recommend writing at least a few hundred words here.** You can always revise Braindump later as story elements change.

> Braindump directly influences the generation of Synopsis. Otherwise, if the Synopsis is never filled in or generated, fields that are typically informed by Synopsis will defer to the Braindump.


---

### Characters

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 1726763-characters
**ID:** 1726763
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-16T10:41:08.702Z

## Characters

The Characters section is where you define the characters in your story. This affects how the characters are described, how their dialogue is written, what choices they make, and how they interact with each other. Once you’ve completed your synopsis, Story Bible can create all of your characters for you.

**To tell Story Bible to create your Characters, click the Generate All Characters button.**

When you generate characters, Story Bible will take what you’ve written in your synopsis and use it to generate the main characters in your story. Characters explicitly mentioned in your synopsis will automatically be included. If you don’t mention any specific characters in your synopsis, or if you only mention a few, Story Bible will create additional characters for your consideration. You can leave these characters as-is, or ideally, change the substance of the character card.

> Characters are generated based on the Synopsis. Meanwhile, the Characters section directly influences the generation of your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

### Character Cards

Each character receives their own card in the Characters section of your Story Bible.

Cards are how you keep track of each individual character and their details. Cards can be collapsed with the arrow next to the characters name, and dragged to your preferred order with the six-dot handle in the upper left.

The dropdown in the upper right allows you to set a Characters role (for example, protagonist, supporting character, etc.). You can see previous versions of the character in the card history—accessed from the clock icon up top—and you can delete a character card using the three dots on the right.

![Character Cards Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/0198aec1-84af-7189-9281-a58824163b8c/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzEtODJhMi03MjA1LTkwMzMtMzNhOTAxNzc3YjA5.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8c4af7128f9a37d445b4f09c36a62d1edff89255ddd87cb0a5fa159e2db90256)

By default, each Character card created includes the following traits: Pronouns, Groups, Other Names, Personality, Background, Physical Description, and Dialogue Style.

### Adding Characters

There are two ways to add characters.

**Add Blank Character** creates a blank character card (with either the default traits, or the custom defaults you’ve assigned) for you to manually complete.

**Generate Character** opens a small prompt window that allows you to ask for a certain type of character. This field is very flexible, and you can be as vague or as specific as you’d like.

**Try this:** Ask for a mentor character, or an antagonist to your existing protagonist, in the Generate Character box. You can even paste a lengthy character brain dump here for a character you already have notes on. Sudowrite’s AI will further develop the character based on your notes, and refine it so that it fits your default card traits.

You can add or generate as many characters as you’d like.

### Character Traits

Most of the default traits are pretty self-explanatory. Personality, Background, Physical Description, and Dialogue Style all help an author distinguish characters from one another and add richer detail to their writing.

But traits are there both for _your_ reference, _and_ that of the AI. **Traits inform how the AI will write a character anywhere that character appears.** And since AI depends on specificity, some traits are _primarily_ for the benefit of the AI.

If your character belongs to a group—say for example that they’re in a D&D group called The Hellfire Club—you’d want to include that group name under **Groups**. That way, if you reference The Hellfire Club in a scene, the AI knows which characters may be involved.

The same goes for **Other Names**. Be sure to include any of your character’s nicknames, pet names, or pseudonyms in Other Names, so that the AI understands who you’re referring to at all times (—for example, when you write Tommy in Chapter 6 and you’re actually referring to the character card for Thomas Culligan).

### Trait Customization

Traits aren’t set in stone. You can retitle existing traits, or even **create custom traits at the individual character level** or **at the default level**.

**Need to add a one-off trait to a character?** (For example, maybe you need a “Bat Form Physical Description” for your vampiric protagonist.) Just click **\+ Add Trait** at the bottom of that character card, title the trait, and then fill out the empty field with details.

**Want all of your characters to have additional traits?** Click the **Customize** button at the top of the Characters section (just below your Synopsis) and you can edit and rearrange your default traits.

![Character Trait Customization Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/0198aec1-83dc-7c22-bf4d-097d6e090fb2/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzEtODI2Ny03MzZiLTgzNTItNjQ1YjI2ODE2MTNl.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2daaf3aed4ec655849e549d6b7f8bafe2996761a717cc5b73667f2c47dd3d345)

Just click **\+ Add** to add a new default trait, and all future characters will be created with that default trait included. This is ideal if you’d like to add your characters’ Enneagram types, core wounds, or story-specific details (like shifter form, for example).

When adding new defaults, you have the option to create fields for those traits across all existing characters. Just note that if you choose to add them on every existing character card, the newly created fields will need to be manually filled out. Freshly-generated characters on the other hand will include the updated defaults, with those trait fields populated on generation.

### Generating Traits

After adding new default traits to pre-existing Character cards or Worldbuilding elements, you may wind up with a bunch of empty trait fields. Traits can always be filled in manually, but sometimes you want the AI’s help with that, so you have the ability to generate traits individually as well.

**When a trait field is empty, just click _Fill This In_.** You’ll have the option to provide custom instructions, but you can also just click _Go_. The AI will then populate that trait field with something contextually appropriate.

The AI takes the rest of your Characters, Worldbuilding elements, and Story Bible context into consideration when generating those traits individually.

You also have the option to Rewrite trait fields that you’re not satisfied with. Just **click Rewrite from within the trait field**, provide custom instructions (if desired), and click Go. The AI looks at the current version of the trait, then rewrites it either according to provided instructions or (if blank) its own intuition and context.

### Character Data

Story Bible’s updated characters section has more structured character data than ever. But **which of Sudowrite’s features make use of your Character data?**

Your characters section is referenced by the Draft tool for the creation of both Scenes and prose generation. Characters are also referenced by the Write button’s Auto and Guided Write modes. And both Quick Edit and Chat can see your characters as well—try asking Chat about any of your character details.

You can fit an absurd amount of data on each Character card, and Story Bible allows for a near-infinite number of Characters. You may see the Characters section referred to as unlimited—but that’s not entirely true. **If you try to add more than 2,000 different characters to your Story Bible you’ll actually hit the limit!** But if you have more than 2,000 characters… well, have you considered you may actually be writing _a phone book_?

### Importing or Exporting Characters

Sometimes you want to pick up on a work in progress, or just create character cards using the notes you’ve already assembled on your characters.

The smart import feature in Story Bible’s Characters section can be used to instantly create character cards from an existing text.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/0198f18d-3382-7e0c-aab5-034f2c6ff2cb/b64u-MDE5OGYxOGQtMzM0OC03MjY2LWFiYTktOTRlZTdhMDlhMjY0.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=cba89b7d5b7ae2dab9fa5b79c139853600a3c0be27dc89a92836f5dda126a9e7)

To use the smart import feature, navigate to the header of the Characters section of Story Bible and click the Import button in the three dots (•••) menu. Doing so opens the Import window.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cbe42d0d96d59b26850/0198f18d-57de-7a67-b535-bfeca2a0a741/b64u-MDE5OGYxOGQtNTZiYy03ZjZiLTgzMzgtNGY3MDEyZGZkOTMx.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260120T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260120%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d069510ecc8f855e931f112b0dd79e7e536e49b666aa85413b1b95fddca61551)

You have the option of importing characters from text or a file. This might be a list of characters, a chapter of your work, or in some cases an entire manuscript.

The raw text pasted in or file uploaded should be no more than 60,000 words. Sudowrite will review that, identify, and import up to 30 characters at a time. Before doing so there is a brief validation step where you can tell Sudowrite not to bother bringing a character in (for example, where it identifies a pseudonym or nickname as a distinct character).

> The Characters section smart import will accept any of the following file types: .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .odt, .csv

Importing characters does not use credits.

### How will Characters be created using the Smart Import?

For "unstructured text" that you paste in or upload by file, Sudowrite will use AI to first identify the characters, and then figure out how best to complete the defined default trait fields.

However, when uploading a CSV, you’re actually not subject to the limits outlined above—you could import more than 30 characters in one shot, if desired. That’s because Sudowrite skips AI if you upload structured data via CSV. It makes the following assumptions:

-   Each row represents a character
    
-   Each column represents a character trait
    
-   The first row of the CSV is assumed to be column headers representing field names
    

If you’d like complete control over the import, you can complete this CSV template manually:

[https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-characters-import-template.csv](https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-characters-import-template.csv)

### Exporting Your Characters

Characters is one of the only Story Bible sections that includes its own Export feature, which allows you to download the entirety of the Characters section, including all of your Characters’ standard and custom traits. Here’s how to use it.

**Characters Export:**

-   Click the three dot (•••) menu option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
    
-   You’ll be presented an Export option
    
-   Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns

### Genre

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 7291201-genre
**ID:** 7291201
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

## Genre

This is where you specify the genre of the story you’re writing, which affects the tropes, tone, and style of the outlines and prose that is generated.

**Examples**

-   _Space opera, science fiction_
    
-   _Historical Romance_
    
-   _Literary Realism_
    

**Pro-tip!** Is the AI writing romance that’s a little too _mushy_? Change it to _romantic_, or avoid it altogether. In general, expanding upon or changing out your genres can help the AI get away from overly tropey writing.

Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

### Outline

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 1761456-outline
**ID:** 1761456
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

### Outline

The Outline is where you tell Story Bible about the structure of your story.

You can have Story Bible generate an outline for you based on your Synopsis, Genre, and Characters, or you can bring your own outline entirely.

> **The Outline section of Story Bible has no word limit.** It can include as many chapters as you like, and each one can be as long as you like. (Though a good editor might suggest otherwise.)

### Generate Outline

There are two ways to approach creating your Story Bible’s Outline: generating it all at once, or chapter-by-chapter.

**To tell Story Bible to create a complete Outline, just click the Generate Outline button.**

Outline generation is influenced by Genre, Synopsis, Characters, and Worldbuilding. Meanwhile, your Outline will directly inform Beat generation.

Alternatively, you can click the **\+ Add** button to add a single chapter to your outline at a time. Once you’ve done so, you can fill that chapter summary in manually or using the **Fill This In…** button. If you choose Fill This In… you’ll be presented with a **Custom Instructions** box, where you can optionally tell Sudowrite how you’d like that chapter to go. If you opt not to give any specific instructions, it will do its best based on the context available.

### Editing Your Generated Outline

If the Outline that Sudowrite generated for you doesn’t match your vision, you can fix it by adding your notes to the **Rewrite Outline** box that appears. Click Go and Sudowrite will take another pass, rewriting the entire outline while incorporating your feedback. (You can get pretty specific with your feedback here!)

Meanwhile, if a specific chapter in your generated outline is almost there but still needs work, you can Rewrite a chapter by clicking into the text field containing the summary and selecting **Rewrite**. Just as with the full outline rewrite, you’ll be able to give specific instructions as to what needs to change (ex. “End in a cliffhanger”)

If your Outline looks great, or just needs a few manual edits, you can simply dismiss the Rewrite Outline box using the X in the upper righthand corner. The Rewrite Outline option will always remain available to you under the Outline section’s (•••) menu.

The (•••) menu also includes the **Delete Outline** option, in case you ever need to start over entirely.

Once you have a generated outline that you’re happy with, make sure the details match your vision for the story. Just as with every other section of the Story Bible, the more specific you are, the better yours results.

### Editing Your Outline

At any point in the Outlining process, you can also Add or generate individual chapter summaries. This can be helpful if you want to rework certain acts or extend your Outline. Click the **\+ Add** button and select Chapter to create a new blank summary field. You can also use the dropdown menu beneath the + Add button to choose where that will be created—it will default to “at the beginning,” and even if you don’t change that you can always rearrange chapter by clicking and dragging them into place.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d1f04f5d5e47043fcfc/0198aec2-942f-76e9-8022-551dd58c0023/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzItOTQwYy03ZDQ0LTg2NTQtYzExMzIxM2QwOTk2.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=30b3767c022054334b23af0f2f51a25b067f574c5698cd219f9312ac1a69dcde)

Your chapters can be named anything you’d like—“Chapter 1, Epilogue, Scene” etc.

You’ll also notice that **Acts** are created when generating an outline, and an option also available under the + Add menu. Acts are like dividers that can be dragged to any point in the Outline to help you organize your outline and visualize the story at a high level. The can be named anything—“Part, Book, Episode, Section” etc.—whatever fits your process, and you don’t need them at all for the Outline to work.

You can delete Chapters or Acts using their respective (•••) menu. If you delete a chapter and want to get it back, you can do that through the History menu (the little Clock icon) in the Outline section header (next to + Add).

### Drafting Your Chapters

When you’re ready to start writing a chapter, click into that chapter’s three dot (•••) menu and select **Create \[chapter name\]**. This will create a document that is automatically linked to this chapter summary portion of your Outline, which allows Write, Draft, and other features to know what to write. You’ll see a list of all the documents which are linked to this part of the outline in this three dot (•••) menu as you write.

### Keeping Your Outline Updated

As you write your book, you’ll probably make changes to your chapters that stray from the original Outline you’d written or generated. You can easily update the linked portion of your Outline with one click by selecting “Update” from the three dot (•••) menu in that chapter’s summary card.

### Scenes & Draft

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 2475330-scenes-and-draft
**ID:** 2475330
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

### Generating Chapter Prose

When using Story Bible sequentially—that is, gradually developing your story from the ground up by completing those fields—the final step of the process will be generating chapter prose using the **Draft** tool. Draft is represented by the little typewriter icon in top right corner of your text editor in Sudowrite.

Draft looks at your Style, Genre, Characters, Worldbuilding, and **Scenes** to write a first draft of that chapter for you. But before you can get help from Sudowrite generating that chapter’s prose, you first need to either write or generate those Scenes.

### What are Scenes?

**Scenes** are the building blocks of chapters in Sudowrite’s Draft tool. They represent distinct moments in your story—each one typically encompassing a single location, timeframe, or character context. A chapter may have one scene, or several.

Scenes let you guide Sudowrite to write your chapter exactly the way you imagine it. Whether you're describing a heated conversation in a cabin, a chase through city streets, or a quiet reflection on a rooftop, each Scene is a self-contained unit of storytelling. This format should feel familiar and intuitive for anyone who has ever read a book or watched a movie—a scene is something happening to someone (or _someones_) somewhere—and it allows Sudowrite to generate focused prose that closely follows your structure and creative vision.

Think of Scenes as the natural atomic units of storytelling—aligned with how writers already plan and think about narrative flow.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d37b929a1bb6c0a2689/0198aec3-00ff-78c8-866d-0e19a9bed15e/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzMtMDA0ZC03NzhiLWE2NGQtZDZkMWY5M2E2YzAw.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=67eae4c4f9160f0e686d469de3acfede306e39b182636c7fee36396b0b22193b)

### **How do I generate chapter prose from Scenes?**

Scenes are the precursor step to prose generation in Sudowrite. Here’s how they work step-by-step:

**1\. Break your chapter down into Scenes**

The top box of the Draft tool is labeled **Scenes**. This is where you list the key narrative moments you want your chapter to contain. Each Scene appears as a numbered item in a list, and may be as short or as long as you like. You can:

-   **Write your own** **Scenes** manually.
    
-   Or click **Generate Scenes** to have Sudowrite generate a list based on your linked Outline’s chapter summary.
    

Scenes take advantage of a feature called Story Bible Detection, which lets you know when something or someone mentioned in a Scene is recognized from your Story Bible. Detected Characters and Worldbuilding elements will appear underlined, whether you generated those Scenes or wrote them yourself.

**2\. Optionally add Extra Instructions**

The Draft box includes an **Extra Instructions** field below your Scenes. This is where you can optionally include specific notes that Sudowrite should consider when writing chapter, including:

-   Point of view (POV)
    
-   Tense (e.g., past or present)
    
-   Style or tone reinforcement (e.g., “dreamlike,” “sparse and fast-paced”)
    
-   Specific plot notes (e.g., “Make sure the antagonist appears at the end”)
    

These instructions can reiterate other parts of your Story Bible, and help Sudowrite better match your unique storytelling voice and intent.

> Sudowrite will generate chapter prose using the default model, Muse, unless you say otherwise. Click the dropdown arrow to the right of the Generate button to toggle between Prose Modes and AI models as desired. Make sure to do so before you click Generate!

**3\. Incorporate helpful feedback**

With those fields complete, you can click Generate to have Sudowrite automatically analyze your Scenes to make sure they’re clear and well-structured. If a Scene looks too short, too sprawling—such as covering too many events, characters, or locations—or something else, you’ll see a friendly suggestion with a proposed fix. You can:

-   Accept the Quick Fix (like splitting a Scene or clarifying it)
    
-   Or ignore the suggestion altogether and proceed with your current Scenes as-is
    

This first stage “check” also creates a word count and credit estimate, so you can know what to expect when you do proceed.

**4\. Generate your chapter**

Once you’re happy with your Scenes and the estimates provided, just click **Generate**. Sudowrite will:

-   Write your chapter in prose, closely following your structure and tone
    

Each Scene is transformed into part of a seamless, compelling chapter draft that should closely match your vision for the story. You can watch the prose magically appear in the document below—and you can always pause the generation if you notice the AI is taking one too many creative liberties.

### Style

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 8450925-style
**ID:** 8450925
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

## Style

Style affects the tone, word choice, and sentence structure the Story Bible uses. What you put here has the most influence on Prose.

**Examples**

-   _Lush prose_
    
-   _Spare and haunting. Written in short sentences with lots of menacing dialogue._
    
-   _Whimsical and dense_
    
-   _Action-packed and violent_
    
-   3rd-person objective POV
    

**Pro-tip!** While not _necessary_, Sudowrite experts recommend tweaking both your Genre and Style boxes in advance of generating a particular chapter, so that you can really dial-in a specific tone. Style in particular has a big impact on prose.

Style is filled in manually—or by using the Match My Style feature—and is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Style directly influences both Beat and Chapter generation.

### Synopsis

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 0063553-synopsis
**ID:** 0063553
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

# Synopsis

Synopsis establishes the characters, their goals, the central conflict, how your story begins and how it ends. It also conveys your story's tone, themes, and unique elements.

**To tell Story Bible to create your Synopsis, click the Generate button.**

If your Braindump is missing crucial elements, Story Bible will fill in the blanks to create the Synopsis here. So be sure to include anything of vital importance to your story in the Braindump!

### Improving your Synopsis

Once Story Bible has generated your Synopsis, you’ll likely want to make changes. These changes can be small, like changing a character name or setting, or big, like restructuring the entire ending. As with Braindump, it’s good to provide as much detail as you can in your Synopsis, because the AI will use this information later on in other sections.

There are two ways to make these changes:

1.  **Make changes manually.**
    

Do this by editing the text of your Synopsis directly in the text box.

1.  **Use AI to rewrite your Synopsis.**
    

You’ll see a “Rewrite Synopsis” box beneath the main Synopsis text box. Use this space to offer the AI some guidance on rewriting your synopsis, the same way you might give a junior writer feedback.

**QUICK TIP**

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6cb45b069893d4fb8adc/0198f190-48b4-7a19-8fcc-bc7988207667/b64u-MDE5OGYxOTAtNDg0Ni03MmRkLThjMmEtNjgzOTNlNTJmYTRi.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c617edd233d94ea0c10163fc8479b695f0ef6be983029cb2d7958ce84582f412)

Use the Clock icon to access this section’s History and see past versions of your Synopsis.

Once you’ve typed the changes you want made, just click the **Rewrite** button.

> **Rewrite Examples**
> 
> -   _Add more tension in the beginning of the story_
>     
> -   _Make the antagonist more likable_
>     
> -   _Change the ending to be sad_
>     

The generation of Synopsis is informed by both Braindump and Genre. The Synopsis influences the generation of Characters, Worldbuilding, Outline, and Scenes. As mentioned previously, in the event the Synopsis field is empty, the fields that rely on Synopsis would instead defer to the Braindump.

# Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting

## Three Steps to Awesome Prose

1️⃣ **Make it your own**

Modify the outputs you get from Story Bible to make them your own and express your unique voice. You’ll probably spot two or three things in each section which you don’t like. Take that opportunity to express your own ideas and you’ll be surprised how much Story Bible will begin to channel your sensibilities!

2️⃣ **Keep it up to date**

As you progress through Story Bible, details about your story will likely change. For example, your characters may evolve, the setting might shift, or you might change the ending. Keeping all of the sections up to date will make sure Story Bible doesn’t get confused as things change.

3️⃣ **You decide what’s important**

One of the creative choices you make in writing with Story Bible is deciding what information you emphasize to your junior writing partner. You might value Characters most and focus on characterization and arc. Or you might prioritize setting, or dialogue. Experiment with different emphases in your Scenes, Style, and elsewhere and see what works best for you.

## The Three Horsemen of Bad Prose

❌ **Vagueness**

Replace any vagueness with specific ideas. Otherwise, Story Bible will fill in the gaps, and that's an opportunity for it to either delight or disappoint you. It won't always delight you!

✏️**Example**

Story Bible suggests _"The two decide to go for a walk"_ as a Beat.

This is OK, but Story Bible doesn't have enough info here to write 200-300 words, so it will look to the other sections for inspiration, and might even repeat something it has said previously.

To fix this, replace this Beat with something specific, like this:

“_The two go for a walk to the cafe around the corner. They hash out ideas for how to deal with the dragon that appeared in their backyard. Andre suggests they train it to do deliveries, while Amber thinks they should kill it."_

In short, generate stronger prose through **specificity**.

❌ **Conflicting information**

If Story Bible finds conflicting information in two or more sections, it will get confused and write something that doesn’t make sense. To avoid this, **make sure all your sections are consistent and delete anything out of date.**

✏️**Example**

Story Bible looks at prior sections to generate the current section. For example, Prose looks at Style, Characters, and Scenes, so if you define a character as _"dreams to become a baker one day"_ but you have a Scene that says _"decides to quit being a baker"_, Story Bible might be confused.

Which is it? Does this character want to be a baker or not!?

To fix the inconsistency, update the character descriptions to reflect your character at the point of time in the story you’re currently writing.

In short, generate stronger prose through **consistency**.

❌ **Confusing wording**

Sometimes we write something down that’s obvious to us but might be confusing to AI. When this happens, Story Bible might write something that is actually reasonable if you read carefully, but appears totally ridiculous on first blush. Try to **be precise in your wording and look for ambiguities** in each section to avoid this

✏️**Example**

You have this Scene:

_"Joey tries to tell Suzie that there’s nothing wrong, but Suzie knows what he did."_

To you this may be obvious. After all, in Chapter 2, Joey accidentally ran over the neighbor’s dog and buried it in the woods, but when writing Prose, Story Bible only looks at Style, Characters, and Scenes, so it doesn’t know what happened in Chapter 2 unless you put it in Scenes. In this case, Story Bible doesn’t know what _”what he did”_ refers to.

To fix this, you could be more precise and write:

_”Suzie knows that he killed and buried the neighbor’s dog secretly”_ as part of the beat.

In short, generate stronger prose through **clarity**.

There’s almost always a rational explanation for any mistake Story Bible makes. As Sherlock Holmes says in _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”

Channel your inner Sherlock, and you’ll get back on track in no time.

### What is Story Bible

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible
**Slug:** 1671191-what-is-story-bible
**ID:** 1671191
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:20:03.447Z

# What is Story Bible

Story Bible gathers the core elements of your story in one place so that you and Sudowrite’s AI can reference them as you expand upon your work. As a feature, it has two purposes:

1.  Help you systematically grow your narrative, beginning with something as simple as a braindump, and ultimately assisting in developing scenes and even your chapter prose.
    
2.  Work as a source of truth that both you and the AI can refer back to later.
    

Each project on Sudowrite has its own Story Bible, and it can be toggled on or off depending on just how you like to work.

# Overview

Working with Story Bible lets you build a long-form narrative from just the seed of an idea. You’ll be guided through the various stages of writing a novel, from synopsis to outline to fully-realized scenes.

Like any other Sudowrite tool, the resulting story is only as good as the writer directing it. Think of it like an improv act: pay attention to what Story Bible writes, then edit and respond with words that are true to your vision. In the end, you will have a first draft of scenes that you can develop further.

You’ll find your Story Bible in the left bar of your Project, beneath your document list.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6c7f628c454516ad35e2/0198f197-5130-76a5-ac7b-ceb917ca4313/b64u-MDE5OGYxOTctNTA3OC03ZDliLWExN2YtZWFjNGNkNzUyNDZm.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=3545e6dfafad6b616ab88f2ab7986c369a22437ca8add63520b431329be19470)

## How to move through Story Bible

Story Bible works a little differently from other parts of Sudowrite. Here are the basics:

-   When Story Bible is toggled on, the individual Story Bible fields will be displayed beneath the prose section of your document.
    
-   Story Bible is persistent—that means as you jump from document to document in your left Project management bar, the same Story Bible contents will remain visible beneath the prose section. (Only the document’s body will be toggled.)
    
-   Click the (❓) icons for details and examples of how exactly a given section of the Story Bible works. This will give you context on what it influences down the line in regards to generation.
    
-   Any section can be manually populated to any degree—but some sections also feature a **Generate** button. Click the **Generate** button and Story Bible will make a suggestion for that section. You can always revise or rewrite these generations to your liking.
    
-   As an alternative to manually editing the generation, whenever you see a **Rewrite** field, you can use that to give Story Bible specific instructions on how you’d like _it_ to modify the generation you’d produced.
    

## How are the Story Bible fields connected?

A common question when it comes to Story Bible is: Which boxes or steps of Story Bible influence _other_ steps of the process. It’s a little complicated, but here’s an explanation. (Don’t worry, you won’t be quizzed on this, and you don’t need to remember it to get great results!)

**Braindump:**

This is the starting point of Story Bible, where you’ll capture your initial ideas for the story. It’s filled in manually, and since it can’t be generated it is not influenced by any of the other fields.

Braindump directly influences the generation of Synopsis. Otherwise, if the Synopsis is never filled in or generated, fields that are typically influenced by Synopsis will defer instead to the Braindump.

**Genre:**

Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields.

Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation in Draft.

**Style:**

Style is filled in manually—or by using the Match My Style feature—and is not informed by any other Story Bible fields.

Style directly influences both Beat and Prose Generation in Draft.

**Synopsis:**

The generation of Synopsis is informed by both Braindump and Genre.

The Synopsis influences the generation of Characters, Worldbuilding, Outline, and Scenes.

As mentioned previously, in the event the Synopsis field is empty, the fields that rely on Synopsis would instead defer to the Braindump.

**Characters:**

Characters are generated based on the Synopsis.

Meanwhile, Characters directly influence the generation of your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Draft.

**Worldbuilding:**

Worldbuilding is influenced by the Synopsis, when generating random Worldbuilding elements.

Meanwhile, Worldbuilding directly informs your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation in Draft.

**Outline:**

Outline is influenced by Genre, Synopsis, Characters, and Worldbuilding.

Meanwhile, Outline directly informs Scene generation.

**Scenes:**

Scene generation considers the most Story Bible context, taking into account Genre, Style, Synopsis, Outline, Characters, and Worldbuilding.

Scenes directly influence Prose Generation in Draft.

**Draft:**

When generating chapter prose, the Draft tool is informed by Style, Genre, Characters, Worldbuilding, and Scenes.

**Note:** Scene and Prose Generation (in Draft) will only look at explicitly mentioned Characters and Worldbuilding elements.

### Worldbuilding

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Bible

## Worldbuilding

The Worldbuilding section of Story Bible is the place to create and store all of the important details of your world—everything from settings, to items, to lore, and beyond. These building blocks help you stay organized, while giving the AI helpful context on your story world. Sudowrite uses the relevant context from your Worldbuilding cards when writing for you.

> N.B. Completing the Worldbuilding section is optional, and you don’t need to add any Worldbuilding cards in order to use the Draft tool. That said, you’ll get better results from the AI if you give it the additional context of frequently-referenced elements—for example, describing a core setting.

When generating Worldbuilding elements, the Worldbuilding section is influenced by the Synopsis. Meanwhile, Worldbuilding directly informs your story’s Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).

The Worldbuilding section is very open-ended. It provides a wide range of templates. No matter what you select, your Worldbuilding entry will be tracked on a collapsible, customizable card.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d00b929a1bb6c09aaf5/0198f189-bc36-7d7d-a918-ab78c558d5f0/b64u-MDE5OGYxODktYmI5Ny03MWU1LTlhOWQtNTIwY2Y3M2IxZWRk.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=3cdd9e8d559ddb7163ae9c2fbc435c2c0baa237a213c12999d520ad24960f3d8)

### Worldbuilding Cards

Each individual Worldbuilding entry gets a card of its own in the Worldbuilding section of your Story Bible.

Cards are how you keep track of each entry, meaning that a card may represent a clue, magic system, setting, or something else altogether. You can select from the card templates available, or create an entirely custom entry using + Custom.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d00b929a1bb6c09aaf5/0198f18a-249c-70d0-b43e-0814d6e2207f/b64u-MDE5OGYxOGEtMjM3NS03MDBmLWJiNWUtZTU5NTY0MjAwZTgy.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=abff70f8f11a1a3837d5d70634c9cc89bba683a6621e5dd01618085b5719a74d)

As with Characters, Worldbuilding entry cards can be collapsed using the arrow next to the element name, and dragged to your preferred order with the six-dot handle in the upper left. The dropdown in the upper right of the card allows you to toggle the Worldbuilding entry type from the available options. You can see previous versions of that card in the card history—accessed from the clock icon up top—and you can delete a Worldbuilding card using the three dots on the right.

### Creating Worldbuilding Entries

You can create Worldbuilding entries with or without the AI’s help. If you click the purple Generate Entry button, you’ll be able to select a type of entry and provide a prompt for what you’re trying to create. This is a great option if you already have notes available, and you want the AI to structure and flesh out those notes.

If you’d prefer to manually complete the card, just select from the available templates. Doing so creates a blank entry with all of the default traits for that entry type.

### Worldbuilding Traits & Trait Customization

Each type of Worldbuilding element has a slightly different set of default traits for you (or the AI) to complete. For example, the Clue template includes a Implications trait, whereas the Item template includes a Who owns this item trait. These traits offer a helpful starting point, but you can add to or change them as desired.

Individual traits can be added at the card level—say for example if you have a specific setting that needs to include HOA details—by clicking + Add Trait at the bottom of that card. Title the trait, and fill it it as desired.

If you’d prefer to add something that should exist across all Setting cards you create, you’ll want to update the Default Traits for all Setting elements by clicking Customize on the Worldbuilding section header. The process is the same for all the element templates—just select a different element from the dropdown.

As with Characters, traits are there both for your reference, and that of the AI. Traits inform how the AI will write about an entry when it is referenced (either directly, or using one of the defined “Other Names”). This is good to keep in mind when you’re titling and populating traits. A general rule is that if a junior writer or copy editor could make sense of your traits, the AI should be able to handle it well.

### Generating Traits

After adding new default traits to pre-existing Character cards or Worldbuilding elements, you may wind up with a bunch of empty trait fields. Traits can always be filled in manually, but sometimes you want the AI’s help with that, so you have the ability to generate traits individually as well.

When a trait field is empty, just click Fill This In. You’ll have the option to provide custom instructions, but you can also just click Go. The AI will then populate that trait field with something contextually appropriate. The AI takes the rest of your Characters, Worldbuilding elements, and Story Bible context into consideration when generating those traits individually. You also have the option to Rewrite trait fields that you’re not satisfied with. Just click Rewrite from within the trait field, provide custom instructions (if desired), and click Go. The AI looks at the current version of the trait, then rewrites it either according to provide instructions or (if blank) its own intuition and context.

### Chapter Continuity

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 8989228-chapter-continuity
**ID:** 8989228
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:33:02.782Z

**Chapter Continuity is a feature that allows you to sequence your documents**, telling Sudowrite which chapter came before which. By linking chapters together, you enable Sudowrite’s AI to treat those separate documents as one continuous story—allowing tools like **Write** and **Draft** to draw on prior context and create smoother transitions, clearer character arcs, and more consistent narratives throughout your work.

## What Chapter Continuity Does

When you define preceding documents in the document linking tool, those documents will be included as additional context for the AI when using certain AI features. Our AI tools—especially Write and Draft—work best when they can draw on previous events, tone, and story structure. Linking your documents ensures that context from earlier chapters helps shape what comes next.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6dcf04f5d5e47045c14e/0198f172-d5ac-7d30-a1b0-54cdca35d58a/b64u-MDE5OGYxNzItZDRiMi03OGU4LTg2MDAtZDQxZjk0NmFmMzZj.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=63bd6b470d6277a79afadac43fc5e0b1fdef675faa876c8e72d092d673cd59f8)

## How to Link Chapters

To create a link between two documents, click the **three dot (•••) menu** that appears next to the document title in your project’s text editor. The Document Linking Menu will appear with two questions:

-   Is this document in your Outline?
    
-   Does this document continue another one?
    

Linking the document to your Outline tells Sudowrite which chapter _this_ document is supposed to be. That context will be used by tools like Write, Draft, Quick Edit, and Chat. Meanwhile, you can select **Connect it** and choose the prior chapter from the dropdown that appears to tell Sudowrite which document precedes this one.

Once you’ve made these selections, the relationships are saved and will remain visible in the Document Linking Menu. You can change or remove this connection—by selecting Disconnect from the dropdown—at any time.

You can continue a document from any other document in your project, whether or not those documents are linked to your Story Bible’s Outline. That said, linking documents _and_ Outline chapter summaries will give Sudowrite even richer context.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6dcf04f5d5e47045c14e/0198f173-2aa0-7e5a-9e07-ef4435b3e966/b64u-MDE5OGYxNzMtMjllMS03YmQ4LWIxMDAtNGI0YTgyZDJjNTdi.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2b3dfa93dbde3479818e1b4f87937707b8515faefe148c3db16ad2e4283f66c7)

## Automatic Linking from the Outline

If you’re generating new chapters from your Outline, Sudowrite will automatically attempt to link them in sequence. For example, if you create Chapter 2 (from either the **\+ New** menu or your Story Bible’s Outline) and there’s already a linked Chapter 1 in the project, Chapter 2 will be created with the Outline’s chapter summary linked and Chapter 1 set as the preceding document. If you skip creating some chapters in the middle—for example, you jump ahead to Chapter 5—Sudowrite will look back for the most recent connected chapter and link to that.

These automatic links are there for your convenience, but you can always change the selections or disconnect a document altogether. This is especially useful for stories with alternating points of view, nonlinear timelines, or other custom structures. It’s also helpful to know that creating a Blank document from the + New menu will create a document without this automatic linking—there will no linked Outline or preceding chapter by default (but you can still make those selections later, if desired).

## Chapter Continuity in Write

When you click the **Write** button in a document that’s linked to a previous one, Sudowrite pulls in up to **20,000 words** of text total from that linked document. If you have several documents connected in series, Write will look at up to **25 previous documents**, starting from the most recent and moving backward until it hits either the word or document limit.

> **For example**, if I’m using the Write button in Chapter 5, and I’ve updated the “Continues from…” setting in each preceding document, the Write button will read Chapter 4, 3, 2, and 1 before it generates. If I had an epic 30,000 word Chapter 4 (for some reason) Write would only read back 20,000 words into Chapter 4.

Write also pulls in up to 20,000 words from the current document—again, starting at the end (or, the cursor position where you’re using the Write feature) and working backward.

This allows Write to stay grounded in the events, characters, and voice of your earlier chapters, with a bias towards the more recent/relevant developments when there’s too much context. Your Write card will include a set of **chiclets** that shows which documents were included, and how many words of each.

![Notion Image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6dcf04f5d5e47045c14e/0198f173-6cdd-717c-ab69-eaf64b6a19df/b64u-MDE5OGYxNzMtNmM0ZC03ODY5LWFlNWYtMmMwYzcxMzQ5MGNi.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c6763991ba0a86e015932071f434909c9297ec35de03bab00f7162c0e822faee)

## Chapter Continuity in Draft

The **Draft** tool also takes full advantage of Chapter Continuity, both when generating Scenes and when writing chapter prose. If your document is linked to a previous chapter, Draft will look backwards through up to 25 documents and incorporate up to 20,000 words of prior content, as with Write. This helps Draft maintain story cohesion, character arcs, and narrative consistency. It also helps the AI make more logical choices in places where it may not have sufficient guidance from you.

As with Write, the most recent documents in the established sequence will be prioritized. In projects with very large chapters or complex continuity chains, some scene-specific context may be crowded out—especially if the AI needs to make room for long chapters. You can always verify what was included in the chiclets of the Draft card created in your History column.

☝ It’s possible for the AI to “max out” on the context you’re trying to show it. Rather than fail, in those cases the AI will proceed by excluding context in the following sequence.

Excluded in order from top to bottom

-   Worldbuilding
    
-   Characters
    
-   Previous Chapter Text
    
-   Linked Outline Summary
    
-   Genre
    
-   Key Details
    
-   Tone
    
-   Style
    
-   Preceding Text from the current document
    
-   Highlighted Text.
    

Write always includes as much as possible—partial inputs from these bits of context may still be passed to the AI when the full ones don’t fit.

## Chapter Continuity Best Practices

Use Chapter Continuity to keep your longform work coherent, but don’t feel constrained by it. Manual linking gives you full control and works well for flexible story structures. Automatic linking is helpful for straightforward chapter sequences based on your Outline, but it’s always editable.

If your Write or Draft results seem off—missing key characters or important events—check the chiclets to see what context was included. Trimming your current document or adjusting linked content can improve performance.

### Saliency Engine

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 6295151-saliency-engine
**ID:** 6295151
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:33:02.782Z

# Saliency Engine

The first thing to know about Saliency Engine is that you won’t find a button or field for it anywhere in Sudowrite. **It’s running behind the scenes to help the AI stay focused on what’s relevant.**

You may have hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements in your Story Bible, but it’s rare that all of those will be relevant when you want to generate the prose for a specific beat. Saliency Engine reviews the task at hand, as well as all of the story information you’ve provided, in order to expose the most relevant information to the AI for prose generation purposes.

![](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e2123b373be38049bd4/0198aec6-9f74-7eef-a562-a6a38331a00b/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzYtOWY3NC03ZWVmLWE1NjItYTZhMmRmOTExMzc0.gif?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a6a41028033218afe1976b2a5290ed059bc9a89ae621b3b381c87770abb7cc7d)

Saliency Engine will **make sense of mountains of story context** in an instant, keeping anything you generate on track. That means, for example, if your shifter is in wolf form, the AI _won't_ reference the pleated khakis they might typically wear to work.

### Which features does Saliency Engine work with?

Right now **Saliency Engine works in three places**: your Story Bible, the Write button (when your Story Bible is enabled), and Plugins. In each case, Saliency Engine will do a first pass to identify information relevant to the writing task at hand before passing those details on to the AI in order to generate text.

### Do I have any control over Saliency Engine?

Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just hover over the Character card and click on the eyeball icon that appears to toggle off the AI visibility.

**When the visibility of a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait is toggled off, Sudowrite’s AI will ignore it altogether.**

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e2123b373be38049bd4/0198aec6-9bad-742c-bdc5-af62845d8f42/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzYtOWI5NS03ZGY3LWJkMGUtMzIxMjY4MWQyOTAy.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5e7bdd7f1291933577a68e17c138e89191c9a67571ba76382deeecbcc603fd3d)

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine _may_ consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. To hide the Motive from Sudowrite, toggle the visibility setting within the Motive trait field from the eyeball icon in the upper right.

![Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e2123b373be38049bd4/0198aec6-9bed-74e7-a358-6d23d2625956/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzYtOWJiOC03YWE0LWFlNTktZDY5ZThlMmNmNjQ2.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b9f5269b77716c3cc70663928f54607d3c05184b4333f513da851d8ef2731ea3)

Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and their traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.

> Remember that hiding a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait from Sudowrite will hide it from all AI features. That means features like Chat, Write, and even Plugins will think it doesn’t exist (because they can’t see it).

### How does Saliency Engine work with Plugins?

Some plugins are designed to use your Story Bible data. In those cases, Saliency Engine may or may not be used, depending entirely on how the creator built that plugin.

-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters }}` or `{{ worldbuilding }}` variables, the Saliency Engine will kick in when necessary.
    

-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters_raw }}` or `{{ worldbuilding_raw }}` variables, the full context of those fields will be passed along into the AI in their entirety. The Saliency Engine will make no attempt to parse the data for relevant context.
    
    -   Note: In most cases, the `raw` version will give the AI _way_ more context. This can either degrade or improve the results, depending on both the plugin configuration and the context passed through as a result… but it will almost always make the Plugin use more credits.
        

> Be Advised: Credit cost is always calculated based on input, output, and the model selected. If a user with hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements uses a Plugin that includes the `raw` version of a variable, a great deal of context will be passed through to the AI. **This could consume a ton of credits!**

All Plugins that predate the Saliency Engine use the standard `{{ characters }}` variable, and so will use Saliency Engine by default.

### Setting POV and Tense

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 4257043-setting-pov-and-tense
**ID:** 4257043
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:33:02.782Z

## Point of View and Tense Settings

Defining the Point of View and Tense of your story helps make sure that assistance from the AI is always on point. Sudowrite now has settings that provide explicit control over both the POV and Tense used by the AI while generating prose.

**The POV and Tense settings are located in Outline section of Story Bible.** They also appear in (and can be changed from) the Draft tool when opened.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/0198aec4-b16b-7dc1-892c-495fb35c44a0/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzQtYjAxOS03MDdlLWIyZWQtOTZkMDdlYTdmZTk4.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2f42c87b975a84f4d6eef9ba0eef226e7e0fa6472c572e0e22ffbd6251898f69)

These settings tell the AI how it should write in the Draft tool, Write button (both Auto and Guided), and Expand, helping to ensure consistency in narrative voice and tense. You have the option of setting a global POV and Tense for your entire novel, or defining them on a per-chapter basis.

## Default Settings

When creating a new project, the POV and Tense is initially set to third-person limited, past tense. If you generate (or write!) a Synopsis in Story Bible, Sudowrite’s AI will intelligently choose the correct POV and Tense for your story. (For instance, a synopsis for a romance novel will likely prompt the AI to select either first-person or third-person limited POV and past tense since those are the POV and tense commonly used for romance novels.)

If you disagree with an AI-defined POV and Tense you can just change it. Once you’ve manually set a POV and Tense, it will remain what you set.

Note: Importing a file using Novel Import or directly into a project will set the POV and Tense settings to their defaults (3rd person limited, past tense).

You can change your POV and tense settings for a project at any time. (Sudowrite won’t attempt to guess your POV/tense once you’ve set one.)

## Point of View (POV) Options

**3rd Person Limited POV** (most common) - Stays close to only one character’s thoughts.

**3rd Person Objective POV** - Writes what a camera would see. No thoughts, just action.

**3rd Person Omniscient POV** - Reveals every character’s thoughts.

**1st Person POV** - Tells the story through the narrator’s eyes.

**2nd Person POV** - Makes “you” the main character.

## Tense Options

**Past Tense** - Creates a feeling of narrative storytelling, with a small distance between the reader and the characters.

**Present Tense** - Creates a more action-packed, dynamic tone. Commonly paired with first-person POV.

**Future Tense** - An unusual choice, useful when you want to create contrast, such as in a prophecy or fable.

## Character POV

If you want your story to be written in first person from your protagonist’s perspective, you can select that character from the Characters section of the POV dropdown menu. All named characters from the Characters section of your project’s Story Bible will automatically appear there.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/0198aec4-b1b0-777b-a341-c3be0e28e1c7/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzQtYjAwOS03ODU4LWFkODktMzEwMDc1ZDFkZjc2.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8cbe1a1551f212054413612632748ead3560fd91855af851f963aa0108f47205)

You can actually assign more than one character to a chosen narrative perspective. When a single character is selected, the AI will write with that character’s perspective in mind. If multiple characters are selected, the AI will use the context of the scene (Draft) or the highlighted or previous text (Write and Expand buttons) to determine the most appropriate character to use.

## POV & Tense Modes

You have two options when it comes to setting your POV and Tense.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/0198aec4-b173-7d10-8f24-ff37057cf4f1/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzQtYjA0Yi03ZTJlLTgzY2ItNjZjMDJlZDY1MmFi.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2885bb763021d6e633bdf3b27b66299c1c9fc7b8bc84d085ca8c8e3c0c1c95b7)

**Same for all chapters (Default):** A single POV and tense setting are applied to the entire novel, ensuring a consistent narrative voice throughout.

**Customize per chapter:** By choosing “Customize” in the _Apply to_ menu, you can customize the POV and tense for each chapter. This is ideal for stories with alternating perspectives or timelines. If you toggle back to “Same for all chapters,” the per-chapter settings are removed and the global settings are reapplied.

Choose your preferred mode in the **Outline section of the Story Bible.**

## Draft Box Settings

When you link a document to a chapter in your Outline (or create a linked chapter from it), the POV and Tense settings from the linked Outline’s chapter are automatically synced to the Draft box.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6d8cc3bf18c3d82dcb28/0198aec4-b605-7bfc-8bd1-04ac19ef73ef/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzQtYjRlZC03Y2VhLTkxZDYtZWExM2ZhNWI4Njg1.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e2cd12043563d9ccb4745e89543da7eadfa7ee3c28e43703e703ce92dfd453c1)

Any changes made to the POV or Tense within the Draft section will be automatically synchronized with the corresponding chapter's settings in the Outline, and vice versa. This ensures that your entire project remains consistent.

For a completely new and unlinked document within the Draft section, the system defaults to a third-person limited POV and past tense.

## Where POV and Tense Works

The settings you choose for POV and Tense tell the AI how to generate prose in the Draft tool. They also influence the Write button’s Auto and Guided modes, and Expand.

**Note:** Plugins can’t currently see these new POV and Tense settings. If you currently use Plugins that rely on a POV and Tense in your Style box, it may be preferable to keep the redundant instruction in your Style box for now.

### Sudowrite Muse

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 6183030-sudowrite-muse
**ID:** 6183030
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:33:02.782Z

# What sets Muse apart?

1.  Basic AI writes boring emails. **Muse is just for fiction.** Focusing Muse entirely on fiction allows it to reach a higher level of quality compared to models which are meant to do everything.
    
2.  Basic AI spews clichés. **Muse writes unique prose every single time.** We specifically measure AI clichés during training and have systematically removed them from Muse’s output.
    
3.  Basic AI loves happy endings. **Muse will write anything – no filters.** Muse is the most unfiltered model on Sudowrite, and embraces the full range of human experience, including violence, and adult themes.
    

You can learn more on the [Muse Webpage](http://sudowrite.com/muse).

# How to use Muse

Muse is the default AI model in Draft and Write. It also powers Expand.

This is what the model selector window looks like. Click “Use Muse” to select it. You will notice that this is where the Creativity setting and Style Examples live.

Sudowrite Muse has a Creativity setting **in Draft**.

-   Use more creativity if you want creative wording, and are willing to let the AI be creative with how the scenes unfold.
    
-   Use less creativity if you know exactly what you want to happen and don’t want the AI to take creative liberties.
    
-   Creativity has a special setting - _11._ This mode works quite differently from the rest.
    

Creativity is document-by-document, in case different chapter different settings for best results.

## Style Examples

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e3ee290301d501beb42/0198aec7-0abd-79fa-bbfc-09fd545ecda4/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzctMDk0Ny03YzFmLTk5ZGQtMjljYmNhMjM1Mjcz.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c07f4ab5a506be5e1e7e685b2385bd8c58eddd6d41d69462ba9f6c2fa611f0aa)

Style Examples are an optional tool **in Draft** that makes Muse write more like you. You can enter up to 1,000 words of examples. For best results, if you include multiple samples from different sources, format them like this:

> Example 1: “lorem ipsum”

This helps clarify that these examples are not a continuous passage.

Style Examples are consistent across your whole account (in other words, across documents and projects).

## Details

-   Muse is available in Draft, Write, and Expand. It is also powering Synopsis in Story Bible.
    
-   Muse is optimized for English for now. It may generate in other languages, but it may need additional prompting to do so reliably.
    
-   Muse is an unfiltered model.
    
-   In Draft, Muse will write up to ~10,000 words at a time.
    
-   In Draft, Muse will read up to 128,000 words in your document above the cursor if you pause and resume.
    
-   In Write, Muse works the same as other models.

### Visibility Settings

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Story Smarts
**Slug:** 6550358-visibility-settings
**ID:** 6550358
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T18:33:02.782Z

### **What if I want to hide something from the AI?**

Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just hover over the Character card and click on the eyeball icon that appears to toggle off the AI visibility.

**When the visibility of a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait is toggled off, Sudowrite’s AI will ignore it altogether.**

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e09266214e17734edfa/0198aec6-2b61-748d-a749-553e39dd4a91/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzYtMmI0My03NzU4LTg1OWYtNjAwOTgyMzdhNWVl.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c68c9c36219d9a3154b6e789d30cc7e89984f6ff6c6a2ea35a1da8174340fb36)

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine _may_ consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. To hide the Motive from Sudowrite, toggle the visibility setting within the Motive trait field from the eyeball icon in the upper right.

![Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6e09266214e17734edfa/0198aec6-2b89-79b2-a06d-5fa25ba63eaa/b64u-MDE5OGFlYzYtMmIzZC03MmVhLWEzMGYtYTYyOWEzNzNlNjli.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=28ef5b5f0451179e4a35bd28abb050367e518ce60151a38ec486de8aac7bdb34)

Click the eyeball icon from within the trait field to toggle that trait’s visibility. When the icon is set to a struck-through eye, the trait is hidden and Sudowrite will ignore it.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and their traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.

> Remember that hiding a Character, Worldbuilding element, or trait from Sudowrite will hide it from all AI features. That means features like Chat, Write, and even Plugins will think it doesn’t exist (because they can’t see it).

### How does Saliency Engine work with Plugins?

Some plugins are designed to use your Story Bible data. In those cases, Saliency Engine may or may not be used, depending entirely on how the creator built that plugin.

-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters }}` or `{{ worldbuilding }}` variables, the Saliency Engine will kick in when necessary.
    
-   If the creator chose to use the `{{ characters_raw }}` or `{{ worldbuilding_raw }}` variables, the full context of those fields will be passed along into the AI in their entirety. The Saliency Engine will make no attempt to parse the data for relevant context.
    
    -   Note: In most cases, the `raw` version will give the AI _way_ more context. This can either degrade or improve the results, depending on both the plugin configuration and the context passed through as a result… but it will almost always make the Plugin use more credits.
        
    -   **Hidden characters or traits will never be visible to the AI**, even if a Plugin is using the a `raw` variable.
        

> **Be Advised:** Credit cost is always calculated based on input, output, and the model selected. If a user with hundreds of Characters or Worldbuilding Elements uses a Plugin that includes the `raw` version of a variable, a great deal of context will be passed through to the AI. **This could consume a ton of credits!**

All Plugins that predate the Saliency Engine use the standard `{{ characters }}` variable, and so will use Saliency Engine by default.

# Prose Modes and AI Models

Authors can use Sudowrite without ever changing the default settings, but it’s still helpful to know that Sudowrite does offer a variety of Prose Modes and AI models to suit different purposes.

Prose Modes are AI model suites specific to Sudowrite, designed specifically for fiction writing. These modes let you experience different output styles at varying costs, each offering unique balances of creativity, control, content filtering, and credit usage. We’ll dive in below on the Prose Modes and AI models available on Sudowrite.

## Muse — Sudowrite's Fiction Model

Muse is Sudowrite's flagship proprietary model, purpose-built just for fiction. It was trained by writers for writers, unlike general AI models that try to "do everything." This focus allows Muse to achieve a higher level of story quality and nuance.

**Prose Quality & Style:** Muse delivers vivid, original prose with a strong creative voice, free from common AI clichés. Excels at rich descriptions, emotional beats, and maintaining consistent tone throughout your story.

**Instruction Following:** Prioritizes creative interpretation over strict obedience. Continues your story in imaginative ways while still incorporating Story Bible context and outline scenes effectively for narrative continuity.

**Content Filter Level:** Virtually none. Handles any content from dark and gritty to light and humorous, including graphic or mature themes that other AIs might refuse. Use discretion, but know Muse won't shy away from adult content.

**Credit Usage:** Higher credit cost than Basic mode (comparable to former "Premium" setting). Many authors find the quality worth the expense, though consider switching to cheaper models for brainstorming or extremely long outputs.

**Best Use Cases:** Ideal for high-quality fiction prose, especially creative, character-driven writing. Excels in impactful scenes, character interactions, and climactic moments. Perfect for unfiltered content including mature themes. Outputs often require less editing than other models.

**Weaknesses:** Not optimized for non-fiction or highly structured tasks. Definitely voice-y, and perhaps not to everyone’s taste. May occasionally produce unexpectedly edgy content. Available exclusively within Sudowrite's ecosystem.

## Excellent — Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Excellent utilizes Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model as its primary engine. This mode is named "Excellent" because it aims for an excellent balance between creative prose and obedience to your instructions.

**Prose Quality:** Produces well-structured, descriptive writing with a flair for action and character movement. While not as stylistically unique as Muse, delivers engaging narrative that typically needs minimal polishing.

**Instruction Following:** Excellent's standout feature. Claude follows complex instructions precisely while maintaining context. Adheres closely to outlines and scenes while still expanding them creatively. Reliable for both storytelling and non-prose tasks like summarizing or brainstorming.

**Content Filter Level:** Moderate. More permissive than OpenAI models regarding violence and mild adult content, but has boundaries. May imply rather than explicitly describe adult situations or graphic content. Handles typical novel scenes well but might gloss over extremely explicit content.

**Credit Usage:** Mid-tier cost—more expensive than Basic but cheaper than Muse. Efficiently provides substantial output without rapidly depleting credits, making it ideal for budget-conscious writers who still want quality.

**Best Use Cases:** Perfect for general drafting and rewriting with balanced creativity and reliability. Excels with dialogue-heavy scenes, structured narratives, and when following outlines closely. Ideal for co-writing projects where story beats and world-building details must be respected. Works well for instruction-heavy tasks in plugins.

**Weaknesses:** Prose can feel less distinctive than Muse, sometimes "safer" or generic with minimal guidance. May faithfully reproduce errors in your outline or scenes. Might not deliver the intensity needed for certain scenes in your first attempt, due to its caution with mature content.

## Basic — GPT-4o Mini Model

Basic uses the lightweight and economical GPT-4o Mini as its backbone. This mode is all about speed and efficiency, giving you decent writing while stretching your credit budget. Don't let the name "Basic" mislead you – it's quite powerful, just tuned for cost-effectiveness.

**Prose Quality:** Delivers coherent, straightforward content that serves as solid first-draft material. Provides clear descriptions without poetic flourishes (e.g., "small and dimly lit room" vs. "bathed in faint flickering light"). Still remarkably competent for its size—better than older GPT-3.5 models with fewer errors, if less original.

**Instruction Following:** Highly obedient and literal, following scenes and instructions closely. Stays on track without introducing unexpected plot elements. Limited "story sense" compared to larger models—won't infer beyond what's explicitly prompted, which can lead to generic output if guidance is minimal.

**Content Filter Level:** Strict, inheriting OpenAI's content moderation. Avoids explicit sexual content and extreme violence, often skipping or neutralizing such elements. Adequate for mainstream fiction but may refuse or severely water down mature content in erotica or intense horror.

**Credit Usage:** Exceptionally credit-efficient—Basic's standout feature. Generates substantial text at minimal cost, making it ideal for limited budgets or massive projects. Perfect for exploratory writing, generating multiple scene versions, or any high-volume text needs.

**Best Use Cases:** Excels at speed-writing, brainstorming, quick drafting, and plot development. Ideal for connective scenes, experimentation, and utility tasks (summarizing, listing ideas). A dependable workhorse for getting words on the page efficiently.

**Weaknesses:** Lacks sophisticated elements like metaphors or emotional subtext. Complex or character-rich scenes may feel flat. May fall back on cliches or tropes in cases. Best used for basics with plans to enhance later.

# Advanced AI Models

Sudowrite's Advanced selector offers AI models beyond the main Prose Modes, including Experimental options and Retired Prose Modes. These provide granular control for specific chapters or specialized plugin tasks. Here's a concise overview of available advanced models:

## Anthropic Models — Claude 3 Suite

Sudowrite provides access to Anthropic's Claude 3 family in three flavors. Claude models are known for knowledgeable, thoughtful writing and a large context window, making them great for novelists who feed a lot of story context.

**Claude 3.0 Opus:** Once the most powerful Claude model (powers the Retired "Best Prose v2"), Opus is still preferred by many. Excels at highly detailed writing with seamless incorporation of Story Bible information and prior chapters. Perfect for complex scenes with callbacks to earlier foreshadowing or intricate settings. Follows sophisticated instructions precisely, producing richly detailed, cohesive output. Drawbacks include slower processing, very high credit usage, and occasional verbosity requiring trimming. Ideal for final polishing or ensuring continuity in complex narratives.

**Claude 3.0, 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet:** Balances speed and quality. Produces high-quality writing with faster turnaround than Opus. Especially strong for action scenes and general chapter drafting with lively, focused descriptions that advance the plot efficiently. More credit-friendly than Opus while maintaining strong output quality requiring minimal editing. Watch for occasional formality in dialogue.

**Claude 3.0, and 3.5 Haiku:** The fastest Claude variant, offering a middle ground between speed and detail. Perfect for everyday writing tasks, transitional scenes, and rapid iteration. Follows prompts reliably with coherent output, though style is more straightforward. Benefits include speed and lower credit cost, making it excellent for experimentation. Less nuanced with complex or emotional content.

The Claude models are widely preferred, and work well for standard genre fiction with a thoughtful, mildly stylistic voice. While Claude models typically feature safety filters that avoid certain themes—sexual content, graphic torture, etc.—they are more permissive in the context of fiction writing on Sudowrite. Note that despite our bucketing here, the higher numbers assigned to these models by Anthropic indicate more recent iterations. That means Claude 3.7 Sonnet is the newest (and therefore most powerful) model available from Anthropic.

## OpenAI Models — GPT-4o and 4.1 Suites

Sudowrite integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 Omni models, which are the evolution of GPT-4 with multimodal capabilities—though in the context of Sudowrite, they are text-only. GPT-4o models are extremely capable in terms of language understanding and generation. They are especially known for factual accuracy, logical coherence, and adherence to instructions, which can be very useful for certain writing scenarios.

### GPT-4o Suite

**GPT-4o (Full):** One of the most versatile AI models available, GPT-4o excels at creating vivid, sensory-rich descriptions and detailed settings. It is particularly good at structured tasks, closely following outlines and maintaining consistency throughout long passages. It's also strong for analytical or complex narrative tasks. The downside includes relatively high credit costs and firm content restrictions—though these are somewhat relaxed within Sudowrite. GPT-4o tends to be cautious with mature content, and authors may need to explicitly prompt deeper emotional nuance. Ideal for scenes requiring precision, final consistency checks, or polished literary prose.

**GPT-4o Mini:** A streamlined, cost-effective variant that powers Sudowrite's Basic mode. GPT-4o Mini delivers impressive quality at reduced cost, producing reliable and clear descriptions without the lush details of its larger counterpart. It maintains strong obedience to instructions and handles large context windows well, ensuring narrative consistency. Particularly useful for general writing tasks, drafting, and plugins, offering a dependable balance of quality and economy.

### GPT-4.1 Suite (New!)

**GPT-4.1 (Full):** GPT-4.1 stands out for its superior ability to follow intricate instructions right from the first draft, making it especially beneficial for authors who need precise adherence to complex plot details. Its remarkable one-million-token context window greatly improves consistency, allowing detailed story continuity across extended narratives—far beyond typical novel lengths. The model's robust story understanding results in fewer required edits and tighter adherence to your vision. GPT-4.1 offers excellent value, often outperforming GPT-4 Turbo (Balanced) in terms of cost-effectiveness and quality, making it suitable for detailed, long-form writing tasks and critical scenes demanding precision.

**GPT-4.1 Mini:** The "brainy" younger sibling of GPT-4.1, this model provides substantial quality at roughly twice the cost of GPT-4o Mini but with notably improved instruction-following and context retention. It's ideal for scenes or chapters requiring a careful balance of creativity and fidelity to detailed outlines or story elements. GPT-4.1 Mini delivers reliable, consistent outputs at an appealing price point for authors who want quality without the full cost of the premium models.

**GPT-4.1 Nano:** GPT-4.1 Nano is remarkably cost-effective—approximately 30% cheaper than GPT-4o Mini—yet still benefits from the GPT-4.1 suite's enhanced instruction-following and memory capabilities. It's perfect for high-volume drafting, brainstorming, and preliminary scene-building, where authors can generate large amounts of text affordably before refining it with a higher-tier model. Though output is simpler and less detailed than its bigger siblings, its economy and improved narrative coherence make it an exceptional value for authors on tighter budgets.

Both GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 suites generally produce precise, grammatically polished text, though the tone may sometimes feel formal or academic. They respond exceptionally well to stylistic guidance, quickly adapting when provided with clear examples of the desired voice or tone.

## DeepSeek Models — Open-Source

DeepSeek is a family of cutting-edge open-source models that Sudowrite has added, especially appealing to those looking for cost-effective alternatives to the big-name APIs. DeepSeek models are trained with novel techniques emphasizing reasoning and economy. They are relatively new (introduced in 2025) and have quickly become popular for certain use cases.

**DeepSeek V3:** Optimized for maximum value—offering performance comparable to larger models at a significantly lower cost. Provides competent, "serviceable" prose with solid grammar and basic creativity. Functions as a blank stylistic canvas you can shape. Even cheaper than GPT-4o Mini, making it among Sudowrite's most credit-efficient options for long-form content. Ideal for quick brainstorming, rough drafts of entire novels on limited budgets, or generating large volumes of content for later enhancement. Output may occasionally contain awkward phrasing but nothing Quick Edit can't fix.

**DeepSeek R1:** Specializes in reasoning power with an internal "thinking" phase before writing. Excels with complex narrative problems, convoluted plots, mysteries with numerous clues, or maintaining character consistency. Produces coherent, logically consistent chapters where characters stay in character and plot threads.

## Other Niche Models

Sudowrite also includes a few other models that cater to specific needs or user preferences. These might not be the top choices for most, but they can be useful in specific scenarios or for experimentation.

**Mythomax 13B:** A 13-billion-parameter open-source model fine-tuned for storytelling. Valued for speed and decent dialogue capabilities. Perfect for quickly generating scene drafts to overcome writer's block. Output is adequate but not deeply polished—expect to rewrite portions. Excellent for casual brainstorming and character dialogue exploration. Sometimes provides creative, unconventional ideas mainstream models might avoid.

**Mistral 7B (Mixtral):** A very small, extremely fast model described as "well-rounded" for new users. Limited to basic tasks like sentence completion or simple rewrites. Produces flat, sometimes repetitive prose over longer passages—not recommended for actual chapter writing. Useful for quick sentence rephrasing or testing continuations without consuming significant credits. Its smaller size means less bias but also less knowledge. Consider it an experimental option, as serious fiction work typically requires larger models.

**Goliath 120B:** A legacy 120-billion parameter model formerly used as Sudowrite's "Unfiltered" Prose Mode before Muse. Creates lengthy, coherent text with a permissive approach to content. Known for natural, conversational tone and potential for humor. Computationally heavy (slower) and less finely tuned than newer models. Sometimes produces shorter outputs requiring extra prompting to continue. With Muse now available, Goliath serves mainly as an alternative voice—its straightforward pulp-fiction style might suit certain scenes, but Muse or DeepSeek V3 typically outperform it on quality and cost.

**(Others):** Sudowrite's model lineup continues evolving. You may see additions like Google's Gemini Pro or other open-source options in the future. Check Sudowrite's changelog for new additions, which typically include usage notes. Models labeled "Experimental" have been implemented and tested, but not exhaustively and results may still vary in different contexts.

## Final Thoughts

Choosing the right AI model in Sudowrite significantly impacts your writing experience. For most fiction writers, start with the main Prose Modes:

-   **Muse:** For premium creative prose with a distinctive voice
    
-   **Excellent:** For balanced, reliable output that follows instructions precisely
    
-   **Basic:** For fast, economical drafting when quantity matters
    

As you grow comfortable with the platform, explore Advanced models for specific needs—Claude 3.7 Sonnet for intricate chapters requiring detail and continuity, DeepSeek Instant for breaking through creative blocks, or Mythomax for quick scene drafts.

Remember that these models serve as collaborators, not replacements. Your voice, editing skill, and creative vision remain irreplaceable. The key is matching the right model to each specific task:

-   Speed vs. style
    
-   Creativity vs. precision
    
-   Unfiltered imagination vs. guided structure
    

By understanding each model's strengths and limitations, you can transform Sudowrite into a personalized writing partner that adapts to different phases of your creative process. Happy writing!

## Workflows

### Collaboration Options

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 7364030-collaboration-options
**ID:** 7364030
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:58:12.183Z

Whether you're working with a collaborator, an editor, or you just want to share your work, Sudowrite offers powerful collaboration features to help you get feedback on your writing. You can effortlessly create and share links to your work and even collect comments from readers, all while maintaining control over the sharing process.

## Document Sharing

Share your writing directly from Sudowrite with beta readers and collaborators. Whether it's a single chapter or a complete manuscript, you can generate shareable links that present your work beautifully.

To share a document:

1.  Click the **Share** icon in the upper right corner of your screen (next to the ⚙️ settings gear).
    
2.  Click the Share button to generate a link for your current document.
    
3.  Alternatively, use the dropdown arrow beside the Share button to share a different document from your project.
    

The link will be automatically copied to your clipboard, and you can always click the Copy button to grab that URL again. Anyone with that link can view your document. Meanwhile, you can click on the project in that Share menu to open the version of your document published to the web.

🧠 A few things to know about document sharing:

-   You can track all of your project’s shared documents in the Share menu
    

-   Unpublish shared documents anytime from that Share menu using the three dot (•••) menu
    

-   Changes you make to your document in the editor are automatically reflected in the shared version (though readers may need to refresh)
    

-   You can share multiple versions of your story by duplicating your document and generating different share links
    

## Clean Copy and Comments

Clean Copy is a feature of Sudowrite’s document sharing functionality that transforms how you collect and manage reader feedback. Share your document, distribute the URL, and each reader gets their own clean copy to comment on if they wish—keeping feedback both organized and private.

Here's how Clean Copy works:

-   Each reader can comment on the document you’ve shared with them by highlighting a passage and leaving their comment in the box that appears.
    
-   If they’re logged into Sudowrite, their display name will appear automatically. If they’re not, they can either log in, set a display name (only necessary once on the first comment they leave), or remain anonymous.
    
-   Readers never see one another’s comments—keeping your feedback unbiased. They will however see any responses that you, as the author, make to their comment.
    
-   Comments will appear along your document's right side. And of course, you can also now comment on your own document from the selection menu, which is super handy for revision workflows and situations where you'd just like to leave yourself notes. If you want to hide comments, just click the comment icon in the document toolbar to toggle them on/off.
    
-   With Comment Mode enabled, you will see all comments you’ve received along the right side of your document.
    
-   As the author, you can also leave yourself comments! No need to do so on a shared document either—you’ll see a **New Comment** option in the selection menu when you highlight a passage in your editor.
    

**Important note:** If you shared documents before Clean Copy was released, you'll need to unpublish and republish those documents to enable commenting.

## Best Practices for Collaboration

-   Unpublish old shared versions when you want to direct readers to newer drafts.
    
-   Use your own comments to track revision ideas while reviewing reader feedback.
    
-   Share different drafts with different groups of readers by creating multiple share links.
    
-   Check that readers are viewing the latest version by having them refresh occasionally.
    

Clean Copy and document sharing make it easy to maintain a smooth feedback process with your readers while keeping your work organized within Sudowrite.

### Exporting Files

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 0052666-exporting-files
**ID:** 0052666
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:58:12.183Z

Sudowrite offers a few different ways to export your work, allowing you to easily save individual files, projects, or Story Bible sections.

## Project Export

Need to backup your entire project or share all of the documents with a collaborator? The Project Export feature is perfect for these scenarios. It allows you to export all of your documents at once as a bundled .zip file.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6c07628c454516abf706/0198aebe-6043-752f-9493-5a597dbfac57/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmUtNWMzMS03NjhmLWExMTMtYTlkMWJjYWJiNzYy.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6eaba181a93c48fee6ff101a784fc5fc1820dc521d5e1919be02b65d4f419a3f)

**Project Export Purpose:** Export every document in a project at once.

**How to use:**

1.  On the Sudowrite home page ([sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com/)) or within the appropriate folder, locate the project card you want to export.
    
2.  Click the three dot (•••) menu in the upper right corner of the project card.
    
3.  Select "Export (.zip)" from the dropdown menu.
    

**Project Export Features:**

-   Exports all documents within the project
    
    -   Note that the export does not include the Story Bible
        
-   Creates a .zip file for easy storage and sharing
    

**Use cases:**

-   Backing up your entire project
    
-   Sharing your complete work with collaborators or editors
    

## Document Export

Sometimes you only need to export a specific chapter or single document from your project. The Document Export option allows you to do just that, giving you flexibility in sharing or backing up individual pieces of your work.

![Notion image](https://66f2e7f2298c40d9d4eb17c1.featurebase-attachments.com/c/article/689f6c07628c454516abf706/0198aebe-6097-72e8-a4ff-eb521c5a3316/b64u-MDE5OGFlYmUtNWMxZS03ZjJhLThmNDAtYjI5NDU3YzFiOWYw.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Date=20260115T230000Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=DO801TYC4FCVNNEKURKM%2F20260115%2Ffra1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=339991462ccbd46b00a3915bd38ad11303122ffbef64be4be9a656eaecad8f49)

**Document Export Purpose:** Export a single document or chapter from your project.

**How to use:**

1.  Open the desired project in Sudowrite.
    
2.  Select the document you want to export in the left sidebar.
    
3.  Click the three dot (•••) menu next to the document name.
    
4.  Select "Export (.docx)" from the dropdown menu.
    

**Features:**

-   Exports a single document as a .docx file
    
-   Generally preserves formatting and content of the selected document
    
-   Quick and easy way to share specific portions of your work
    

**Use cases:**

-   Sharing a single chapter with beta readers
    
-   Creating a standalone copy of a document for offline editing
    

Note that if you’re primarily looking to export a document in order to share it with a collaborator, you may be better served by using Sudowrite’s Document Sharing functionality. Details on Document Sharing, and the collaboration feature we call Clean Copy, are available here: [Collaboration Options](/1a07975fa0ec8074a65dc02f25d4540e)

## Story Bible Export

Neither Project Export nor Document Export include your Story Bible contents by default. Some authors choose to copy and paste those fields into a document manually in order to export them, but two sections of the Story Bible have their own Export functionalities.

**Outline Export:**

-   Click the three dot (•••) menu option in the Outline section header of your Story Bible
    
-   You’ll be presented an Export option
    
-   Once Exported, you’ll receive a two-column .CSV file with your chapter names in the left column and corresponding chapter summaries in the right column
    

**Characters Export:**

-   Click the three dot (•••) menu option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
    
-   You’ll be presented an Export option
    
-   Once Exported, you’ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns

### Importing Files

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 5186529-importing-files
**ID:** 5186529
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:58:12.183Z

Sudowrite offers several different ways to import your existing work or works-in-progress. Each method serves a different purpose and has its own unique features. Let’s explore the available options to help you choose the best one for your needs.

## Import Novel

Do you have a work-in-progress that you’re excited to bring into Sudowrite to continue? Or perhaps you're gearing up to write a sequel and need a comprehensive Story Bible based on your previous work? The Import Novel feature is perfect for these scenarios. It's a one-stop solution that brings your entire manuscript into Sudowrite and fills in your Story Bible for you in the process.

**Import Novel Purpose:** Create an entirely new project with a pre-populated Story Bible based on your partial or complete manuscript (or even a less-than-organized pile of notes).

**How to use Import Novel:**

1.  Click the "Import" button in the upper left corner of your Sudowrite home page.
    
2.  Drag a file into the Import modal or click "Browse" to select a file from your computer.
    
3.  Wait for the import process to complete (typically a few minutes, but may take up to 10 minutes for complex manuscripts).
    

**Import Novel Features:**

-   Automatically creates a new Sudowrite project
    
-   Populates the Story Bible with the essential components, including characters, world-building elements, and a detailed outline
    
-   Optimized for documents up to 120,000 words
    
-   Focuses on importing 5-7 primary characters
    
-   Supports .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, and .odt file types
    

**Import Novel Limitations:**

-   Always creates a new project to avoid conflicts with existing Story Bible data
    
-   May generate placeholder names for unnamed characters
    
-   Very long outlines may be saved as separate documents (though we’re working on improving the Outline section of Story Bible to better support long outlines)
    

## 2\. Smart Character Import

Already working on a project in Sudowrite but want to quickly add an exhaustive Character list from a pre-existing chapter (or even an entire manuscript)? The Smart Character Import is your go-to tool. It's especially useful in cases where you decide to pull characters from an existing work mid-stream.

**Smart Character Import Purpose:** Quickly populate the Characters section of an existing Story Bible.

**How to use Smart Character Import:**

1.  Navigate to the Characters section of your Story Bible.
    
2.  Click the three dots (•••) menu in the header and select "Import".
    
3.  Choose to import from text or a file.
    

**Smart Character Import Features:**

-   Can import up to 30 characters at a time
    
-   Accepts text input or file upload (up to 60,000 words)
    
-   Supports .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .odt, and .csv file types
    
-   Allows for validation before importing characters
    
-   Does not use credits
    

**CSV Import Option:** The Smart Character Import option also allows you to optionally import a full character list using our CSV template. This bypasses the 30-character limit of the Smart Import, and works like this:

-   Assumes each row represents a character and each column a character trait
    
-   First row should contain column headers (field names)
    
-   Get the template here: [Sudowrite Character Import Template](https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-characters-import-template.csv)
    

## 3\. Outline Import

Already have a full or partial Outline for your book? The Outline section of Story Bible allows you to bring that Outline in—whether it’s formatted tidily or not.

**Outline Import Purpose:** Bring in a pre-existing Outline to your Story Bible.

**How to use Outline Import:**

1.  Navigate to the Outline section of your Story Bible.
    
2.  Click the three dots (•••) menu in the right corner of the header and select "Import Outline".
    
3.  Paste in your Outline or select a file. The default Outline Import will pull in what you provide as closely as possible, only making light changes required to fit Story Bible’s requirements.
    

**Outline Import Features:**

-   Accepts text input or file upload
    
-   Supports .txt, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .odt, and .csv file types
    
-   Does not use credits
    

**CSV Import Option:** If you want to bring in your Outline _exactly_ as-is, and ensure the AI does not make any tweaks in the process, you can download the Outline CSV template and fill it out. Simply title Chapters as desired in the left column, and provide chapter details in the right. This rigid structure ensures that Sudowrite will take in your Outline without making any edits.

-   You can also get that template here: [Outline Import Template](https://editor.sudowrite.com/assets/sudowrite-outline-template.csv)
    

## 4\. Document Import

Sometimes all you need is to get your existing work into an existing Sudowrite project so you can get to work. Maybe you've written a few chapters already, or just want to use Sudowrite for the powerful editing tools. The simple Document Import is ideal for these situations, allowing you to bring in content without affecting your existing Story Bible or project structure.

**Document Import Purpose:** Add an existing document to your project without affecting the Story Bible.

**How to use:**

1.  In an existing project, click the "Import" button in the editor's left bar.
    
2.  Select the file you want to import.
    

**Features:**

-   Creates a single document in your project containing the full imported text
    
-   No limit on document size
    
-   Preserves any existing Story Bible content
    
-   Allows for manual Story Bible creation or editing after import
    

By choosing the appropriate import method, you can efficiently bring your existing work into Sudowrite while maintaining control over how it integrates with your project structure and Story Bible. Whether you're starting fresh with a completed manuscript, populating your character list, or simply adding content to an existing project, Sudowrite has an import option tailored to your needs.

### Organizing Your Projects

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 6639290-organizing-your-projects
**ID:** 6639290
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03T17:58:12.183Z

Everyone has their own system when it comes to organizing their work, and now you can bring yours to Sudowrite. **Project** **Folders** can be used to track your project status, group your work by series or pen name, or just keep your desktop tidy.

You can create folders from the **\+ New** button in the upper lefthand corner, just like you would a new project. **Drag and drop** projects directly onto a folder to move them, or use the **Move to** option available in the three dot (•••) menu. A few things to know about folders:

-   Hover over any folder to **preview your 3 most recent projects** in that folder
    
-   **Click on a preview to go directly into that project** without opening the folder!
    
-   You can **create or move folders inside of folders**
    
-   Navigate easily with the **file path** provided at the top of your screen in folders
    
-   **Projects can be dragged over that file path** to relocate them
    

When you delete a folder, all its contents move to trash together. Don't worry—you can restore entire folders (and their contents) from the **Deleted projects** page, available via the Settings menu (⚙️) in the upper right, if you need them back.

🗂️ **Folders transcript**

While the visuals in the video above help illustrate the workflows outlined here, a transcript of the Folders video above is available by expanding this toggle.

Project folders are a new way to keep yourself focused and organized on Sudowrite. Here's how they work: First, click "New" in the upper left and select "Folder" to create a new folder. You can name that folder by selecting the name and typing - just hit return when you're done. Then you can move projects into that folder by just clicking and dragging. You'll be presented with a little preview of the projects that that folder contains. You can hover over the preview to flip through the projects, and you can even click straight into one of those projects from here without even opening the folder.

If there's a project that's a little bit far for clicking and dragging, you can use the three dots in the upper right and select "Move to" from the drop-down menu that appears. That will allow you to move it into any available folder. Folders can also contain other folders for even greater organization - just click "New" again inside of a folder to create a folder right there.

Here I can drag something one layer deeper, and then inside of that folder, I have a file path appear up top so I know exactly where I am. If I want to move something back out to another folder, I could use "Move to," or I can actually just drag on top of that file path and it will move where I drop it.

If I'm done with a folder, I can delete it from the three-dot menu. In tidying up the homepage, we've also moved deleted projects, so those now live here in the settings gear. You can click into "Deleted Projects" to see both projects and folders that you've deleted, and you can also restore them from the three-dot menu.

That's it! We hope these changes help you create a more organized workspace that lets you get more done.

### Using the Sudowrite Mobile App

**Collection:** Using Sudowrite > Workflows
**Slug:** 8875915-using-the-sudowrite-mobile-app
**ID:** 8875915
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20T23:30:00.000Z


# Using the Sudowrite Mobile App

> **Note:** This article has been split into multiple detailed articles. For comprehensive mobile app documentation, please see the **Sudowrite's Mobile App** section.

Sudowrite's iOS app is a companion app for iPhone that lets you work on your stories whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. Access your projects, write on the go, and even dictate new ideas with our mobile-exclusive feature: Smart Dictation.

## Getting Started

You can find the iOS app in the Apple App Store on your iPhone. The first time you launch the app, you’ll be prompted to log in. Be sure to use the same authentication method and details you use at sudowrite.com.

When you open the Sudowrite app, you’ll land on your **Projects screen**, which is a scrollable linear version of your homepage on sudowrite.com.

Your **Projects** appear as book icons, and **Folders** as—surprise!—folders. You can tap the **🔍 Search icon** (in the top right) to quickly find any project. Open the **Settings panel** by swiping in from the left edge of your screen, or tapping the **three bar (☰) icon** in the left of the bottom menu.

## Mobile Settings Panel

Inside the Settings panel, you can:

-   View your **account details** (including associated email address and remaining Credits).
    
-   Adjust your **editor settings**.
    
-   Access:
    
    -   **Your Rambles**, to review all dictated entries.
        
    -   **Help**, which links directly to our support documentation.
        
    -   **Feedback**, to tell us how we’re doing.
        
-   Sign out of your account.
    

## Navigating Projects

Tap on any project to dive in. The first thing you’ll see is the **Project Overview**, a list of **documents and folders** that looks just like the left document bar in a project on Sudowrite. You can tap on any document to read its title and contents, or you can click the **➕ Plus icon** in the right side of the bottom menu bar to **create**:

-   New documents
    
-   New folders
    
-   New rambles (more on that below!)
    

🛑**Heads up:** This iteration of the Sudowrite mobile app **does not include the AI features you’re used** to (like Write, Rewrite or Describe). It’s read and write only—for now, but some version of those are coming soon. The only AI feature in the app right now is Ramble.

## Story Bible Access

You can access (and edit) all of the information in your project’s Story Bible using the **📖 book icon** in the left middle of the bottom menu bar. You can:

-   Browse all your existing Story Bible fields, including **Characters** and **Worldbuilding** cards.
    
-   Note: **Custom worldbuilding types** are view-only and cannot be renamed on iOS (yet!).
    

You may make manual edits to your Story Bible here too, but you don’t currently have the same generation options you have on the web.

## Creating & Organizing Content

The options available to you under **➕ Plus** in the bottom menu bar depend on whether you’re at the home screen or inside of a Project’s Overview.

From the home screen, you may use the **➕ Plus icon to:**

-   **Refresh** your content if something you created on web hasn’t appeared yet.
    
-   Create a **New Project**.
    
-   Create a **New Folder**.
    
-   Create a **New Ramble**.
    

Meanwhile, from the **➕ Plus icon** inside of a project, you may:

-   Create a **New Document**.
    
-   Create a **New Folder**.
    
-   Create a **New Ramble**.
    

To **move a Project or Document** into or out of a folder, just press and hold on it—you’ll see a **Move** option appear.

## 🎙️ Introducing Rambles (iOS-only!)

Ramble lets you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page with nothing but your voice! Think of it as enriched, story-aware dictation—start a Ramble to share a story idea or concept, and Sudowrite’s AI will aim to shape that into a cohesive narrative. (Don’t worry, it will provide a transcript of your Ramble too!)

### Start a Ramble:

-   Tap the **🎤 microphone icon** in the center of the bottom menu **OR**
    
-   Swipe down from the top of the app (like refreshing a page) on the home screen or inside of a project.
    

Sudowrite will request mic access the very first time. Once you grant permission:

-   You’re live! Just talk—tell a story, monologue, world-build out loud. Dead air is totally fine, so feel free to think out loud as you go.
    
-   When you click the red stop button, Sudowrite will:
    
    -   Save your **verbatim transcript**.
        
    -   Create a cleaned up, **narrative version**—as if you’d written it yourself.
        

If you ramble **inside of a project**, the cleaned-up, narrative version **uses your Story Bible.** Since the AI has context on Characters and plot points from your Story Bible, those details will influence the arc of the narrative you’ve spoken about.

Rambling from the **homepage** (outside a project) works too—but no Story Bible magic there.

🗑️Started a ramble by accident? Tap the **trash can** to cancel.

Rambles are **exclusive to the app** and don’t appear on sudowrite.com.

## Syncing with the Web App

The app and [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com) should stay in sync automatically. However, if you don’t see a new document or folder you created on web:

1.  Tap the **➕ button** in the main screen’s menu bar.
    
2.  Choose **Refresh**.
    

This will re-sync your project view with the latest updates from sudowrite.com.

📌**Sudowrite Mobile App Pro Tips**

-   When in doubt, **Refresh** to sync.
    
-   For **project-specific Rambles**, always start from _inside_ that project.
    
-   Rambles work best when you’re willing to think out loud. While the AI doesn’t need a ton to go on, some key narrative elements help it piece things together.
    

We built the iOS app for momentum—so you can keep writing even when you’re away from your desk. Whether it’s a whispered dialogue at midnight or a note you tap out on a train, the Sudowrite app helps your story stay in motion.

Our classes run the gamut, from core curriculum courses focused on Sudowrite, to special topics courses focused on writing craft or AI. Some examples of sessions we run regularly include:

-   **Sudowrite 101** - This introduction to Sudowrite is a full hour session reviewing some of the fundamentals and Sudowrite’s core tools. By the end of this beginner’s session you should be familiar with the interface and have a good idea of how to get started.
    
-   **Sudowrite 201** - This intermediate class is generally focused on the full workflow, using tools like Story Bible to go from idea to fully developed outline or even chapter prose.
    
-   **Sudowrite 301** - This advanced session is typically focused on how to get the specific results you’re looking for out of Sudowrite, massaging your inputs and requests in order to get the prose you’re looking for out of the tools available.
    
-   **Sudowrite 4XX & Special Topics** - Once you’ve mastered the fundamentals of Sudowrite, you can move on to any number of concentrations. Our 400-level courses and special topic sessions range from genre-specific deep-dives, to language focuses, to sessions focused on using Sudowrite for spicy and NSFW content.
    

Even if you can’t make our live sessions, you can catch the class recordings in the #course-videos channel in our community Discord server.

## Community

### Ambassadors

**Collection:** Resources > Community
**Slug:** 3568979-ambassadors
**ID:** 3568979
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-04T16:26:04.030Z

Sudowrite’s Ambassador program is a way for our most active and passionate authors to shape, support, and grow our community alongside us. If you’re already one of the more active voices in the community and feel like you have exciting ideas for the future of Sudowrite, this may be for you!

## What are Ambassadors?

In short, Sudowrite’s best and brightest! Ambassadors contribute to our product and community in a myriad of ways, including…

-   **Resourcing the community!** Connecting folks in our Discord and out on the world wide web to resources they need to have a great experience with Sudowrite.
    
-   **Creating videos!** Highlighting tips and best practices, exploring popular topics, and sharing these on our YouTube or in our Discord community.
    
-   **Hosting live sessions!** From classes to informal social gatherings, Ambassadors contribute significantly to our live programming efforts.
    
-   **Contributing to crowd-sourced docs!** Creating valuable documentation that helps everyone get the most out of Sudowrite.
    
-   **Giving product feedback!** Our Ambassadors get early access to new tools and features so that they can help us make them better.
    
-   …\*and many other projects which help to grow and support the Sudowrite community.
    

Sudowrite Ambassadors are invited on a quarterly basis, and active Ambassadors will be re-invited each quarter as long as they remain active and in good standing.

## Perks

Being an Ambassador is an incredible way to give back to the Sudowrite community—so here are a few ways we give back to Ambassadors:

-   Free monthly Professional plan!
    
-   Featured Discord roles with special server privileges
    
-   Guaranteed early access to our latest features and beta tests
    
-   Access to the Sudowrite team, and the opportunity to offer direct feedback on our feature roadmap
    
-   And more role-specific perks too!
    

Most Ambassadors ultimately participate because they're passionate about Sudowrite and want to help others succeed. The perks are a nice bonus—we think they’re well deserved!—but the _real_ reward is being an integral part of our vibrant community and shaping the future of Sudowrite.

## How do I become an Ambassador?

We love your ambition! The first step to becoming an Ambassador is simply being an active member of community—either in our Discord server, or out there in the world. Next, you should have a clear idea for how exactly you’d like to get involved, whether that’s producing content, answering questions, or something else.

📌While it’s not a strict requirement, we’re generally looking for folks who have been a member of our Discord community for 6+ months.

When you’re ready to apply, you can [**fill out this Ambassador application form**](https://airtable.com/appzYmPFcz9Wxzn0X/shrmqE2y2snfRhd5N). We review all applicants on a quarterly cycle, at the beginning of February, May, August, and November.

### Community Guidelines

**Collection:** Resources > Community
**Slug:** 4486684-community-guidelines
**ID:** 4486684
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-04T16:25:16.107Z

The [**Sudowrite Discord community**](https://discord.gg/sudowrite) is a place for authors and writers working with AI to hang out, share ideas, and learn from one another. There are people from all over the world and people of all ages in our community. Every day they’re experimenting and making discoveries that push the boundaries of just what you can do with AI—and the written word.

These Community Guidelines include our values, rules, and expectations of behavior. They’re intended to help us stay aligned, maintain positive vibes, and uphold a safe environment for everyone.

**Values**

**🐱 Curiosity and open mindedness** We get the best results from each other (and AI!) when we approach ideas and others with an open mind and orient ourselves around curiosity. “What if the opposite is true?” as a mantra.

**🤝 Helpfulness and friendship** We expect that everyone brings a spirit of collaboration, acts in friendship, and assumes the best of intentions. Remember, sometimes folks just haven’t had their coffee yet!

**⚙️ Experimentation and action!** The thing that makes this community awesome is the people in it—and we love to see you all take action. If you need help, ask! If you see a problem you can solve, speak up. If you have an idea for something awesome the community should do, pitch us or set it up!

**Rules**

Below you’ll find an overview of the rules by which we govern the Sudowrite community—which is not limited to but in part consists of our Discord server, our remote and in-person events, and our Plugins ecosystem.

To keep our community a warm and welcoming space, Staff members will enforce the rules below through moderation. While we expect that everyone will play by the rules, be advised that we may take action (ranging from warnings to bans) in the event that you don’t.

1️⃣ Be kind and respectful - Help us cultivate a welcoming environment. Operate with good intent, and assume positive intent from others. When offering feedback, make it constructive.

2️⃣ Promote positive interactions - We prioritize the safety and well-being of our community members. Hatred, bigotry, and harassment are all expressly prohibited here. Troll-like behavior and other forms of abuse may also result in your expulsion from the community.

3️⃣ Respect the space - Keep the channels on topic. Also, we welcome self-promotion as it relates to your work with Sudowrite—for example, videos, blogs or podcasts documenting your use. But self-promotion isn't cool when it means using this space for extractive, commercial, or unrelated reasons. That said, there’s a celebrations channel for a reason—celebrate your wins, or link to your freshly published books! (If you find yourself unsure, just ask Michael or any staff member.)

4️⃣ Help keep things safe - If you see something against the rules or something that makes you (or another community member) feel unsafe, please notify a staff member. And if you see something that isn’t against the letter of the rules, but feels against the spirit, please let us know.

**Expectations of Behavior**

Sudowrite Staff members, Ambassadors, and sometimes other members of the community will host events—ranging from product tours, to informal co-working sessions, to genre happy hours, to structured classes. These events may take place in audio or video channels in Discord, over Zoom, or occasionally even in-person.

We encourage you attend and participate in these events, but we do have some baseline expectations of behavior for those doing so. Event attendees agree to:

**📗 Share the floor** - We want you to get your questions answered in any session you attend, but we also ask that you be aware of the space you take. That way, other attendees have the time and opportunity to have their questions answered as well.

**📙 Bring mindfulness and respect** - You’re joining a shared space, and we ask you to conduct yourself accordingly. This includes turning your camera off if you’re indisposed, and maintaining composure in the chat.

**📕 Listen to teacher** - Different instructors may have different rules for their sessions—raised hands only, queue up questions in the chat, etc.—depending on the format, topic, and attendance. We expect that, in those situations, you will defer to your instructor’s preferences.

### Discord Server

Sudowrite has a community Discord server available, where you can connect with other curious and friendly, forward-thinking authors.

**👉** [**Join the community Discord server here now: https://discord.gg/sudowrite**](https://discord.gg/sudowrite)

We know that not everyone is on Discord, and new tools can be overwhelming—so we hosted a Discord open house to try and demystify both the tool, and the unique setup of our server. It’s hosted on our YouTube, but you can watch it right here.
