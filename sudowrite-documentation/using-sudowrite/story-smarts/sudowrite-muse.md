# What sets Muse apart?

1.  Basic AI writes boring emails. **Muse is just for fiction.** Focusing Muse entirely on fiction allows it to reach a higher level of quality compared to models which are meant to do everything.
    
2.  Basic AI spews clichés. **Muse writes unique prose every single time.** We specifically measure AI clichés during training and have systematically removed them from Muse’s output.
    
3.  Basic AI loves happy endings. **Muse will write anything – no filters.** Muse is the most unfiltered model on Sudowrite, and embraces the full range of human experience, including violence, and adult themes.

Sudowrite Muse has a Creativity setting **in Draft**.

-   Use more creativity if you want creative wording, and are willing to let the AI be creative with how the scenes unfold.
    
-   Use less creativity if you know exactly what you want to happen and don’t want the AI to take creative liberties.
    
-   Creativity has a special setting - _11._ This mode works quite differently from the rest.
    

Creativity is document-by-document, in case different chapter different settings for best results.

## Style Examples

Style Examples are an optional tool **in Draft** that makes Muse write more like you. You can enter up to 1,000 words of examples. For best results, if you include multiple samples from different sources, format them like this:

> Example 1: “lorem ipsum”

This helps clarify that these examples are not a continuous passage.

Style Examples are consistent across your whole account (in other words, across documents and projects).
