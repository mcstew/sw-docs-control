## Finding Plugins

There are two ways to access the Plugins directory, and find all of the community-created Plugins currently available.

1.  The Directory is linked from the home page:

2.  And when you have a Project open, you will find a Plugins option in the main menu:

## Adding Plugins

The Plugins Directory page lists all of the available Plugins.

The Plugins Directory, with featured Plugin cards pictured up top.

You can select Categories along the left to view Plugins according to their category, and you can use the filter views available to sort by Popular (most installed) or Newest (most recently published). Note that you also have filter views available for Plugins you’ve added or built.

To add a plugin, just click “Add” on that Plugin’s baseball card. You can also click into the card to visit the Plugin’s Description page and read more about it.

An example of the Plugin Description page.

The Description page includes details on the creator, how many users it has, an estimation of how many credits it might use, and a Description written by the creator. The Description should give you a good idea of what the Plugin is intended to do, and ideally how to use it.

Some creators may choose to make their Plugin Instructions visible, and if they’ve done so, those will appear on this page as well.

In the upper right, you’ll see a Copy Link button (if you’d like to share the Plugin) and an Add button, which will install it. To use the Plugin, you’ll have to click Add.

Once you’ve added a Plugin, you will see it available in all of your projects under the **Plugins** dropdown in the top right of your toolbar.

To use a Plugin, just select it from this dropdown. But take note: The Plugins you install may work in one of many different ways. They may require you to highlight text, or put your cursor somewhere in particular. Some Plugins even ask you to structure the text in your document in a particular way, or write specific text (sometimes in a specific format) and highlight _that_. It’s important to familiarize yourself with how a Plugin works (again, on the Description page) before using it in order to achieve the best results.

Plugins output to the History column on the right, just like other Sudowrite features. And just like with those features, you can favorite, insert, and copy these cards as desired.
