## What are Plugins?

Sudowrite Plugins allow you to create powerful, custom AI functions for anyone on Sudowrite to use. Here’s a brief video introduction to Plugins.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are custom features, that allow Sudowrite to do cool new things it couldn’t do otherwise. Think of them a little like browser extensions, which expand the capability of your web browser. Your web browser doesn’t necessarily come with an ad blocker, or a password manager, but you can install extensions that do those things.

Plugins work similarly. If there’s ever a tool you need that doesn’t appear to be a feature of Sudowrite, you can find a Plugin, or even build your own custom Plugin, to tackle it. It’s a way to dial in your dream workflow. You may want to share these with the community in our directory, or if they’re super specific to your process you can keep them unlisted while still using them yourself.

## What can Plugins do?

Basically _anything_ an author might want to do… but saying “anything you want” is not very instructive! Instead, it may be helpful to know the three major functions a Plugin might serve:

**Writing** - Plugins can generate text according to your instructions.

**Editing** - Plugins can transform text according to your instructions.

**Analysis** - Plugins can analyze text according to your instructions.

But the thing that makes Plugins super powerful is that they can also do any combination of these things. So maybe you want to analyze a chapter of your work according to a set of rules you have for yourself. A Plugin could do that and generate an analysis for your reference—or you could have it generate the analysis, and then make the edits to the text directly based on that analysis.

Plugins are super flexible!
