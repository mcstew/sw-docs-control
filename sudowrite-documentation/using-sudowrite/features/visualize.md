## **What is Visualize?**

Visualize is a feature that brings your writing to life by generating images based on your text. Whether you're describing a character, setting a scene, or painting a vivid landscape with your words, Visualize transforms your descriptions into visual representations—giving you a new perspective on your work.

This feature is especially helpful for:

-   Seeing how readers might imagine your descriptions
    
-   Visualizing characters or settings to ensure consistency
    
-   Finding inspiration when you're stuck
    
-   Bridging the gap between written descriptions and visual imagination
    

## How to use Visualize

Visualize appears in the Plugins dropdown menu when you have text selected in your document. Here's how to use it:

1.  Select a passage of text (minimum 10 words) that contains descriptive content
    
2.  Click on the **Plugins** dropdown in the toolbar
    
3.  Select **Visualize** from the list
    
4.  Wait a moment while our AI generates an image based on your selection
    
5.  View the generated image in the right sidebar
    

Once your image appears, you can:

-   Insert it directly into your document
    
-   Save it to your computer
    
-   Favorite it for later reference
    

> **ICYMI:** Visualize only appears when you have text selected. Make sure your selection contains enough descriptive detail (at least 10 words) for the best results.

## For best results from Visualize

The quality of your generated images depends on the detail in your text. Here are some tips:

-   **Be specific:** Include colors, textures, lighting, and other visual details
    
-   **Set the scene:** Describe the environment and atmosphere
    
-   **Focus on the most important elements:** What do you want to stand out?
    
-   **Keep it cohesive:** Conflicting descriptions might result in unusual images
    

For example, instead of:

"A castle on a hill."

Try:

"A gothic stone castle perched on a misty green hill, its dark spires piercing the dawn sky, with stained glass windows glinting in the morning light."

Essentially, use the same descriptive language you’d use when trying to conjure an image in your reader's mind for best results.
