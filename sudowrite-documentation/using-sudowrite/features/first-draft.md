First Draft is a feature that helps you get the ball rolling when you don’t know where to begin. Whether you’re working on a novel, blog post, article, or essay, First Draft will generate up to **3000 words** based on a prompt you provide—giving you a solid jumping-off point to work from.

It’s intended for that early, idea-spark moment, before you’ve written anything in the document. First Draft offers a substantial foundation you can then edit, refine, or build on.

## How to use First Draft

**First Draft only appears when your document is completely empty.** Here’s how to find it:

1.  **Open a blank document** inside any Sudowrite project.
    
2.  Click on the **Plugins** dropdown in the toolbar.
    
3.  Select **First Draft** from the list.
    

You’ll see a field appear with some example prompts to inspire you below. Just complete that field and click Go!

> **ICYMI:** First Draft only appears in totally blank documents. You won’t find it in the Plugins menu if you’re working in a document you’ve already written in.

### For best results from First Draft

The more detail you provide, the better the draft will be. Here are a few tips:

-   **Fiction?** Include character names, settings, and key events.
    
-   **Non-fiction?** Share the structure or argument you want to make.
    
-   **Something else?** Mention tone, style, or any specific quirks you’d like to see.
    

We recommend giving as much detail as you can here. A sentence or two is fine, but a full paragraph is better. As you type, First Draft gives you feedback on how to improve your prompt—think of it as a writing coach guiding you toward a stronger start.

## What you can expect from First Draft

Once you submit your prompt, Sudowrite will stream a first draft directly into the editor. The draft is:

-   Tailored to the type of content you asked for (fiction or non-fiction)
    
-   Inserted as regular text, ready for immediate editing
    
-   Generated with beautiful sparkles—so you can follow along as it appears!
    

Whether it’s a moody short story opening or a structured blog article, First Draft gives you something real to react to.

## When you should use it

First Draft is perfect if you:

-   Don’t know how to start your story or essay
    
-   Want a quick spark of inspiration
    
-   Prefer editing and shaping over generating from scratch
    
-   Need to experiment with tone, structure, or POV without starting from zero
    

Some common use cases include:

-   Fiction scenes and character intros
    
-   Personal essays or blog entries
    
-   Opinion pieces or structured arguments
    
-   Genre-specific prompts like thrillers, romance, or historical fiction
