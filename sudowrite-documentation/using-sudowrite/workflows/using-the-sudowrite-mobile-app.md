Sudowrite’s iOS app is a companion app for iPhone that lets you work on your stories whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. Access your projects, write on the go, and even dictate new ideas with our mobile-exclusive feature: Ramble mode.

## Getting Started

You can find the iOS app in the Apple App Store on your iPhone. The first time you launch the app, you’ll be prompted to log in. Be sure to use the same authentication method and details you use at sudowrite.com.

When you open the Sudowrite app, you’ll land on your **Projects screen**, which is a scrollable linear version of your homepage on sudowrite.com.

Your **Projects** appear as book icons, and **Folders** as—surprise!—folders. You can tap the **🔍 Search icon** (in the top right) to quickly find any project. Open the **Settings panel** by swiping in from the left edge of your screen, or tapping the **three bar (☰) icon** in the left of the bottom menu.

## Mobile Settings Panel

Inside the Settings panel, you can:

-   View your **account details** (including associated email address and remaining Credits).
    
-   Adjust your **editor settings**.
    
-   Access:
    
    -   **Your Rambles**, to review all dictated entries.
        
    -   **Help**, which links directly to our support documentation.
        
    -   **Feedback**, to tell us how we’re doing.
        
-   Sign out of your account.
    

## Navigating Projects

Tap on any project to dive in. The first thing you’ll see is the **Project Overview**, a list of **documents and folders** that looks just like the left document bar in a project on Sudowrite. You can tap on any document to read its title and contents, or you can click the **➕ Plus icon** in the right side of the bottom menu bar to **create**:

-   New documents
    
-   New folders
    
-   New rambles (more on that below!)
    

🛑**Heads up:** This iteration of the Sudowrite mobile app **does not include the AI features you’re used** to (like Write, Rewrite or Describe). It’s read and write only—for now, but some version of those are coming soon. The only AI feature in the app right now is Ramble.

## Story Bible Access

You can access (and edit) all of the information in your project’s Story Bible using the **📖 book icon** in the left middle of the bottom menu bar. You can:

-   Browse all your existing Story Bible fields, including **Characters** and **Worldbuilding** cards.
    
-   Note: **Custom worldbuilding types** are view-only and cannot be renamed on iOS (yet!).
    

You may make manual edits to your Story Bible here too, but you don’t currently have the same generation options you have on the web.

## Creating & Organizing Content

The options available to you under **➕ Plus** in the bottom menu bar depend on whether you’re at the home screen or inside of a Project’s Overview.

From the home screen, you may use the **➕ Plus icon to:**

-   **Refresh** your content if something you created on web hasn’t appeared yet.
    
-   Create a **New Project**.
    
-   Create a **New Folder**.
    
-   Create a **New Ramble**.
    

Meanwhile, from the **➕ Plus icon** inside of a project, you may:

-   Create a **New Document**.
    
-   Create a **New Folder**.
    
-   Create a **New Ramble**.
    

To **move a Project or Document** into or out of a folder, just press and hold on it—you’ll see a **Move** option appear.

## 🎙️ Introducing Rambles (iOS-only!)

Ramble lets you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page with nothing but your voice! Think of it as enriched, story-aware dictation—start a Ramble to share a story idea or concept, and Sudowrite’s AI will aim to shape that into a cohesive narrative. (Don’t worry, it will provide a transcript of your Ramble too!)

### Start a Ramble:

-   Tap the **🎤 microphone icon** in the center of the bottom menu **OR**
    
-   Swipe down from the top of the app (like refreshing a page) on the home screen or inside of a project.
    

Sudowrite will request mic access the very first time. Once you grant permission:

-   You’re live! Just talk—tell a story, monologue, world-build out loud. Dead air is totally fine, so feel free to think out loud as you go.
    
-   When you click the red stop button, Sudowrite will:
    
    -   Save your **verbatim transcript**.
        
    -   Create a cleaned up, **narrative version**—as if you’d written it yourself.
        

If you ramble **inside of a project**, the cleaned-up, narrative version **uses your Story Bible.** Since the AI has context on Characters and plot points from your Story Bible, those details will influence the arc of the narrative you’ve spoken about.

Rambling from the **homepage** (outside a project) works too—but no Story Bible magic there.

🗑️Started a ramble by accident? Tap the **trash can** to cancel.

Rambles are **exclusive to the app** and don’t appear on sudowrite.com.

## Syncing with the Web App

The app and [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com) should stay in sync automatically. However, if you don’t see a new document or folder you created on web:

1.  Tap the **➕ button** in the main screen’s menu bar.
    
2.  Choose **Refresh**.
    

This will re-sync your project view with the latest updates from sudowrite.com.

📌**Sudowrite Mobile App Pro Tips**

-   When in doubt, **Refresh** to sync.
    
-   For **project-specific Rambles**, always start from _inside_ that project.
    
-   Rambles work best when you’re willing to think out loud. While the AI doesn’t need a ton to go on, some key narrative elements help it piece things together.
    

We built the iOS app for momentum—so you can keep writing even when you’re away from your desk. Whether it’s a whispered dialogue at midnight or a note you tap out on a train, the Sudowrite app helps your story stay in motion.
