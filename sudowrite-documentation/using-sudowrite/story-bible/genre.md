## Genre

This is where you specify the genre of the story you’re writing, which affects the tropes, tone, and style of the outlines and prose that is generated.

**Examples**

-   _Space opera, science fiction_
    
-   _Historical Romance_
    
-   _Literary Realism_
    

**Pro-tip!** Is the AI writing romance that’s a little too _mushy_? Change it to _romantic_, or avoid it altogether. In general, expanding upon or changing out your genres can help the AI get away from overly tropey writing.

Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).
