## Genre

This is where you specify the genre of the story you’re writing, which affects the tropes, tone, and style of the outlines and prose that’s generated by Sudowrite. Rather than jotting down a literal genre, we recommend you unpack some of the themes and thematic elements you’re looking for in your story.

✏️ **Examples**

-   _Space opera, science fiction_
    
-   _Historical Romance_
    
-   _Literary Realism_
    
-   _Alt history timeloop_ </aside>
    

✨ **Pro-tip!** Is the AI writing romance that’s a little _tired_? Change it to _friends to lovers romance_, or _small town cozy romance_, or avoid the term _romance_ altogether. In general, you’ll get the best (least tropey) results if you can unpack the thematic elements you’re actually looking for.

Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).
