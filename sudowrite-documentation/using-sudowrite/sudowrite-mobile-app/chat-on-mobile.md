# Chat on Mobile

## Mobile Chat

The mobile app Chat is a unique feature that provides three different AI agents who can read, write, and manage your project content. It’s like working with a writing partner that can actually *do stuff* for you right there in your projects.

### Accessing Chat

1. Click Chat in the bottom nav bar. You’ll be asked to select a project. (Alternatively, you can tap on Chat when already inside of a project)
2. Select your agent in the upper left, and start chatting

**Note:** The speech bubble in the top right of a document shows document comments (a different feature).

**The Three Agents**

**Edna:**

- Smart, critical, and concise
- Professional and straightforward

**Alexis:**

- A bit of a stinker (more playful personality)

**Jeff:**

- Friendly and supportive
- "Just a real nice guy"

The main difference between agents is personality and temperament. Choose based on the type of feedback and interaction style you prefer.

### What Chat Can Do

**Document Management:**

- List, retrieve, and read documents
- Create new documents
- Insert content into existing documents

**Story Bible Management:**

- Read and update Story Bible
- Generate characters
- Update character details
- Add custom traits

**Outline Management:**

- Read current outline
- Create chapter summaries
- Add new chapters to outline
- Revise existing outline entries

**World Building:**

- Create and manage world building entries
- Update locations, magic systems, etc.

**Feedback & Brainstorming:**

- Character arc development
- Find repetitive phrases
- Eliminate head-hopping
- Workshop scenes
- General writing advice

### How to Use Chat

1. Either tap the sparkle mic to Smart Dictate your request in the chat field or type it manually
2. Send your message
3. The agent will read your project context and respond
4. The agent can automatically make changes to your project (create characters, add to outline, etc.) as requested

### Chat Management

**Per-Project Conversations:**

- Each *project* has its own separate chat thread with each agent
- You can have one chat with each agent concurrently, per project
- Chat threads don't cross between agents

**Clearing Chat History:**

1. Tap the **More menu (•••)** in the upper right
2. Select **Clear Chat**
3. This resets the agent's context for a fresh start

🚧

**Important:** Chat on mobile is *different* from web chat, both in capability and history. Conversation threads do not sync between platforms, and a chat you have on mobile cannot be seen on the web app.

### Example Chat Workflows

**Generating a Character:**

```
You: "Can you create a mentor character for Cavendish and add it to my Story Bible?"
Agent: [Creates character card in Story Bible with full details and confirms it's been added]

```

**Creating Outline Entries:**

```
You: "I need a chapter summary for chapter 4. They arrive at the bean farm under cover of night and begin investigating. The chapter ends with Barbara falling down a cavern."
Agent: [Drafts summary and offers to add it to your outline]
You: "Yes, add it"
Agent: [Confirms chapter 4 added to outline]

```
