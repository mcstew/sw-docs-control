## Mobile vs. Web App

While the mobile app was originally intended to be a **companion app** to the full web app, it can be used exclusively if desired. The key principle: if you have a full keyboard at a desk, you definitely have more features available and AI options via the web app. For everything else (walks, trains, capturing ideas on the go), use the mobile app.

### Feature Differences

**Web App:**

-   Full suite of features, including Story Bible’s generation tools
    
-   4-5 different ways to accomplish most tasks
    
-   Access to the entire Plugins ecosystem
    
-   Document History and (Project and Document) Trash access
    

**Mobile App:**

-   Streamlined, simplified interface
    
-   Typically 2 ways to accomplish tasks (use the feature or ask chat)
    
-   Four core features: Write, Rewrite, Chat, and Smart Dictation
    
-   Story Bible access—generations limited to the Chat workflow
    
-   No Trash or Document History access (must use web to recover deleted items)
