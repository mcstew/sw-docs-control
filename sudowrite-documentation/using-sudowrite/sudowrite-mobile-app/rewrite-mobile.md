The mobile app’s Rewrite allows you to transform any selected text with AI assistance.

### How to Use Rewrite

1.  Select the text you want to improve
    
2.  Tap the **Rewrite** button (cursive lowercase "a" with star, at the very top right of the screen)
    
3.  Choose from preset options:
    
    -   Make it shorter
        
    -   Make it more descriptive
        
    -   Show, don't tell
        
    -   And more...
        
4.  Or select **Custom** to write your own instructions
    
5.  Tap **Generate**
    
6.  **Insert** to replace the original text, the copy icon to copy, or **Dismiss** to cancel
    

Generated rewrites also appear in purple initially and lose the formatting when edited.
