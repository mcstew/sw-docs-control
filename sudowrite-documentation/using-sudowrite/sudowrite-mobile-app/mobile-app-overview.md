# Overview

The Sudowrite mobile app is an **AI-powered writing assistant** **available for both iOS and Android** devices. It serves as a companion app to the full web app at [sudowrite.com](http://sudowrite.com), allowing you to take your work on the go, maintain momentum, and capture fresh ideas wherever you are.

### What is Sudowrite?

Sudowrite is an AI writing partner designed to help authors achieve their writing goals. It functions as a junior writing assistant, editor, and creative companion. It can help you get unstuck and stay inspired, keep you organized and help you maintain momentum, and speed up your process (so you can focus on the parts of it you love).

-   Full series management currently requires the web app
    

### Deleting Items

**Important:** While you can delete both projects and documents, the mobile app does not have a trash can for projects presently.

-   Deleted documents go to the trash inside of a project and may be recovered from there
    
-   Deleted projects go to a trash that is unavailable on mobile
    
-   To recover deleted projects, log in to the web app

## Story Bible

### Accessing Story Bible

From your app’s project screen or within any project, tap the **Story Bible icon** (the small book-shaped icon) in the nav bar along the bottom of the app. If you select this from the project screen, you’ll be asked which project you would like to see the Story Bible for.

### What You Can Do

**Read & Edit:**

-   View all sections of Story Bible
    
-   Edit any Story Bible information
    
-   Access and edit Characters, including full character cards
    
-   View and edit Worldbuilding elements
    
-   Add new custom Traits to Characters and Worldbuilding elements
    

**What You Cannot Do:**

The Story Bible on mobile does not have generative elements, such as Character generation or “Fill this in” completion. That means you can’t:

-   Generate new characters
    
-   Generate Synopsis from Braindump
    
-   Generate Worldbuilding elements
    

**Workaround:** Use the Chat feature to ask an agent to generate Story Bible content for you!

### Creating Story Bible Elements Manually

1.  Open Story Bible
    
2.  Navigate to the relevant section (Characters, Outline, etc.)
    
3.  Tap the **+** button in the upper right to add new entries
    
4.  Fill in details manually
