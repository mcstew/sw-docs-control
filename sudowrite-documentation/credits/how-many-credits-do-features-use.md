Since credit use is calculated based on a task’s complexity, **different features on Sudowrite use different numbers of credits**. Simple, targeted features like Write or Describe are very credit-efficient—whereas asking Sudowrite to generate a full chapter of prose from your Scenes will consume quite a few credits.

We worked up this chart to illustrate the potential range, but it’s important to note that even these numbers may vary, given that you can select alternative Prose Modes or AI models to do the work.

While credits power Sudowrite’s AI features, not _every_ feature of Sudowrite uses up credits. **Our Quick Edit and Chat features are** **included** **with your Sudowrite plan, and free to use by default.** (Though an optional High Quality mode, which _will_ use credits, is available in both.) We’ve also been known to introduce free-to-use models and beta tests on a time-limited basis.
