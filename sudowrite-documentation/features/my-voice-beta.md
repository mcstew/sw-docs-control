Ever wish it was easier to make prose sound more like _you_?

**My Voice lets you train a private, custom model on your work so that Sudowrite can instantly rewrite anything in your voice.** It works like magic, whether what you’re transforming was originally written by the AI or a human writing partner.

✌️ There are two simple steps to using My Voice.

1.  Train a custom My Voice on some existing work.
    
2.  Use that My Voice model to restyle prose.
    

## What you’ll need to create a My Voice model

-   **Existing work:** Have a **sample of your own, human-written text** ready to go. It should be representative of the style you’re looking to replicate.
    
-   **Sample criteria:** Minimum of **1,000 words** with no upper limit. The sample _quality_ is the most important consideration.
    
-   **File types:** Upload a `.txt` file **or** just copy/paste text directly into the modal.
    

⚠️ **Important note**

Avoid using AI-generated text as your training data; it can reduce the quality of the resulting model.

## How to train your My Voice model

1.  Head to Sudowrite and **open any document.**
    
2.  In the bottom of the left sidebar, click **My Voice**—or [just click right here](https://editor.sudowrite.com/app/my-voice).
    
3.  Click **Train New My Voice**.
    
4.  Choose one:
    
    -   **Upload** a `.txt` file, or
        
    -   **Paste** your sample into the text box.
        
5.  Click **Start training**. Training typically takes less than **2 minutes**.
    
6.  When training finishes, you’re returned to the My Voice model list, where your new voice appears.
    
    -   By default, it’s named after your file (or the first part of pasted text).
        
    
    -   To rename it, open the **More (⋯) menu** next to the model and choose **Rename**. This is also where you’ll delete a voice.
        

## Use your voice to revise text

Think of My Voice primarily as an **editing** tool that helps you take a first draft to second, third, and beyond.

1.  **Open your project** and highlight the text you want to transform.
    
    -   You can select **short snippets** or **large sections** (up to **4,000 words**).
        
2.  Select **My Voice** in the Selection Menu that appears to rewrite the highlighted prose in the selected style.
    
    1.  Alternatively, click the down arrow (⌄) next to **My Voice** and choose your preferred model (e.g., _Regency style_). Your most-recently selected model will persist.
        
3.  A card will appear in the History section on the right with your rewritten prose.

## Controlling the My Voice intensity

You may find that the first time you use My Voice to rewrite a passage, the style is either too subtle or too pronounced for your liking. Fortunately, you can easily change the intensity of a My Voice rewrite. To do so, simply tweak the **Creativity** slider in your **Write Settings**. (You can find the Write Settings beneath the down arrow next to the Write button in the top toolbar.)

-   **Lower Creativity** → lighter edits, less apparent style, closer to the source.
    
-   **Higher Creativity** → stronger more pronounced rewrites with more stylistic change.
    

**Recommended workflow:** Start near the middle, then adjust up or down based on your preference.

☝️ **Tips & best practices**

-   **Match POV & tense:** Train with samples in the **same point of view and tense** as your target work for most predictable results.
    

-   **Selection length ↔ style strength:**
    
    -   On **short selections**, **high** Creativity may cause the model to **expand** more than you want. If it overwrites or “keeps going,” **lower** your Creativity.
        
    
    -   On **long selections** (approaching 4,000 words), you may need to **raise** Creativity to see sufficient stylistic impact.
        

-   **Iterate to intensify style:** For extra impact, copy the rewritten prose from your My Voice card in the History section, paste it back into your draft, and **run My Voice on it again** for a second pass.
    

## What else to know

-   My Voices are stored privately in your Sudowrite account, accessible only to you. **They are not project-specific**, however, which means you can use any My Voice you train in any of your projects.
    

## Troubleshooting

-   **“It didn’t change much.”**
    
    -   Increase **Creativity** or select a longer passage. Ensure your training sample is strong and representative.
        
-   **“It changed too much / kept writing past my selection.”**
    
    -   Lower **Creativity** and select a slightly longer span for more context.
        
-   **“Results feel off.”**
    
    -   Check that your training sample matches your project’s **POV and tense**, and avoid AI-generated training text.
