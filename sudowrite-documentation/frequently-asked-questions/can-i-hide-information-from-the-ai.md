Sometimes, you want to keep the AI in the dark about your Characters or Worldbuilding elements. For that, we’ve introduced **visibility settings** at both the card and trait level.

If you’ve added a character that doesn’t appear until later in your story, and you’d like to make sure the AI ignores that character until then, you can hide them from Sudowrite. Just click the eyeball icon that appears on the Character card when you hover your cursor over them.

**When the eyeball is clicked (and appears struck-through), Sudowrite’s AI will ignore that card or trait altogether.**

Alternatively, lets say you want to include a Motive trait on the Character Card for the murderer in your mystery. Saliency Engine _may_ consider a motive relevant to a scene, leading to an AI generation that spills the beans prematurely. You can prevent this by hiding the Motive from Sudowrite’s AI, which you’d do by toggling the visibility of the trait field itself.

Just hover over a trait field and click the eyeball. Once the eyeball appears struck-through, the trait is hidden from Sudowrite’s AI.

All Character and Worldbuilding cards and traits are visible to the AI by default. That means, unless you say otherwise by dictating what is visible, Sudowrite’s Saliency Engine will decide whether or not those bits of story context are relevant to the task at hand.

You can toggle the visibility settings as often as necessary.
