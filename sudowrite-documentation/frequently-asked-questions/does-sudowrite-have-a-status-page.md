Yes! You can keep track of Sudowrite’s current status at [https://status.sudowrite.com/](https://status.sudowrite.com/).

In the event that Sudowrite or one of our AI model providers experiences downtime or an outage, we will create and update an incident report on our status page. We’ll update you on our investigations and resolutions at the incident report on that status page.

You can sign up for email notifications to stay current, or join our Discord community where we cross-post these notifications to a #status channel. (That status channel in Discord also highlights outages documented by our AI providers.)

Here’s an embedded preview of the Sudowrite status page:
