Yes! We’ve just launched a mobile iOS app—and we’re currently in beta with our Android app as well. This app is a companion app rather than a replacement for Sudowrite’s web editor. That means it does not include all of the AI functions you’d have on the web (but it does have one really neat mobile-specific feature). You can learn more about Sudowrite for iOS here: [Using the Sudowrite Mobile App](/1ea7975fa0ec800cbf78e8ffcb4d3b2c)
