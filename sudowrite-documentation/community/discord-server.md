Sudowrite has a community Discord server available, where you can connect with other curious and friendly, forward-thinking authors.

**👉** [**Join the community Discord server here now: https://discord.gg/sudowrite**](https://discord.gg/sudowrite)

We know that not everyone is on Discord, and new tools can be overwhelming—so we hosted a Discord open house to try and demystify both the tool, and the unique setup of our server. It’s hosted on our YouTube, but you can watch it right here.
