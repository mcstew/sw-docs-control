Our classes run the gamut, from core curriculum courses focused on Sudowrite, to special topics courses focused on writing craft or AI. Some examples of sessions we run regularly include:

-   **Sudowrite 101** - This introduction to Sudowrite is a full hour session reviewing some of the fundamentals and Sudowrite’s core tools. By the end of this beginner’s session you should be familiar with the interface and have a good idea of how to get started.
    
-   **Sudowrite 201** - This intermediate class is generally focused on the full workflow, using tools like Story Bible to go from idea to fully developed outline or even chapter prose.
    
-   **Sudowrite 301** - This advanced session is typically focused on how to get the specific results you’re looking for out of Sudowrite, massaging your inputs and requests in order to get the prose you’re looking for out of the tools available.
    
-   **Sudowrite 4XX & Special Topics** - Once you’ve mastered the fundamentals of Sudowrite, you can move on to any number of concentrations. Our 400-level courses and special topic sessions range from genre-specific deep-dives, to language focuses, to sessions focused on using Sudowrite for spicy and NSFW content.
    

Even if you can’t make our live sessions, you can catch the class recordings in the #course-videos channel in our community Discord server.
