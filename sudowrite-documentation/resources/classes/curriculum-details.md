Sudowrite offers **free live classes** almost every day of the week. We cover a wide variety of topics, genres, and workflows, with sessions ranging from working with Sudowrite to writing craft in general.

### How the curriculum is structured

-   **Quick Start sessions** (zero Sudowrite experience required)
    
    Quick Start sessions are beginner-friendly classes that don’t assume you have a handle on Sudowrite yet. These are perfect as your first class, or if you’re returning to Sudowrite after a break.
    
-   **Deep Dive sessions** (you already know the basics)
    
    Deep Dive sessions go into more granular detail around certain workflows or processes. These sessions are able to cover more complex topics because they assume you’re already comfortable with Sudowrite fundamentals. Great for those who want to get “in the weeds” on specific tools.
    
-   **Workshops** (hands-on, create alongside an instructor)
    
    Workshops are practical, creative sessions where you can actively work on your writing with guidance—often centered on a theme (e.g., planning/goal setting, writing diverse stories, etc.).
    

### Regular weekly sessions you can always rely on

-   **Weekly Welcome Session**: a “zero to one” onboarding that walks brand-new users through the essentials and gives you the foundation to navigate Sudowrite confidently.
    
-   **Office Hours**: a looser, unstructured help session where attendees bring questions, troubleshoot workflows, and learn by watching others’ problems get solved.

### Why attend?

As Octavia E. Butler said, "Forget talent. If you have it, fine. Use it. If you don’t have it, it doesn’t matter. As habit is more dependable than inspiration, continued learning is more dependable than talent."
