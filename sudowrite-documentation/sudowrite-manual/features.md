Here’s a quick look at some of the main AI features available within Sudowrite’s editor.

-   **Write**
    
    -   _Auto_ is for when you don’t know what should come next and you just want to see what the AI comes up with.
        
    -   _Guided_ is for when you have an idea of what should happen but want Sudowrite to draft it for you.
        
-   **Describe** adds rich sensory details—sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste—to any moment or object.
    
-   **Rewrite** improves phrasing, flow, or tone in an existing passage.
    
-   **Brainstorm** helps generate lists of ideas: names, powers, plot twists, worldbuilding elements, and more.
    
-   **First Draft** generates an extended scene (typically 500–1,000+ words) based on an outline or set of notes.
    
-   **Expand** adds length to your draft—whether that means slowing pacing or fleshing out a moment. _(Tip: Use Describe if what you need is added detail.)_
    
-   **Plugins** are customizable tools that extend Sudowrite’s core functionality. Use them to tweak tone, change POV, enhance dialogue, and more.
    
-   **Scenes** (found in the Draft tool) are the new, structured way to outline and generate your chapters. Each scene focuses on a specific time, place, or POV, and supports **Extra Instructions** to guide tone, pacing, and style. (Note: Scenes replaced the older _Beats_ system.)
