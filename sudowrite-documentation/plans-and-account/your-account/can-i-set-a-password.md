# Can I set a password?

Logging into Sudowrite

For security purposes, we do not currently authenticate accounts with passwords. Instead, we use passwordless authentication, which is accomplished via an emailed link. It means only the holder of the email account will ever be able to access your Sudowrite account.

We do, however, support other methods like logging in via Google! If you like, you can click "Log in with Google" via the login screen, and this will allow you to enter the site without checking your email for the magic link.
