If you’ve exhausted your monthly credit allotment but would like to keep using Sudowrite’s AI features, you can make one-time purchases of extra credits as necessary. You’ll receive a banner with a link in the event you run out of your monthly credits, but you can also find this option at any time inside of your Settings—just click the (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right, and then select Buy More Credits.

> **Note:** In order to purchase additional credits, you must have an active Sudowrite subscription.

Purchased credits do not expire. They remain associated with your account until they are used up—even if you pause or cancel—but do note that you need to have an active account in order to use them.

It’s also worth noting that Sudowrite will always default to using monthly credits first. That means that if you’ve purchased credits and then see your monthly credits refresh hit your account, Sudowrite will automatically start using the credits that will expire at the end of the month. This helps you reserve the non-expiring purchased credits for the future, in the event that you exhaust your monthly credits again.
