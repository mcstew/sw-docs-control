Your credit usage can be tracked through the Recent Activity log, accessible via the Settings menu—just click the (⚙️) gear icon in the upper right, and select “Show Recent Activity” from the Settings panel. This log provides a detailed list of the features you've used and the credits consumed by each, helping you monitor and manage your credit use.
