To pause or cancel your account, click on the Settings (⚙️) gear icon in the top right corner of Sudowrite, and select "Manage Membership." From there, you'll find options to either pause or cancel your subscription, manage your billing, or contact us.

## **What’s the difference between “pausing” and “canceling”?**

### Pausing

**Pausing** a Sudowrite subscription is only available to users on monthly plans. This is because a pause takes effect at the end of your billing cycle, and monthly plans renew every month, whereas annual plans only renew once a year.

When you pause your subscription, you can temporarily stop your billing and credit refresh for up to **three months**. However, pausing requires an additional confirmation step that’s easy to miss. After initiating the pause, you’ll be taken to a separate confirmation page. If this step is not completed, the pause won’t go through. We recommend double-checking your status or referring to the help screenshot, which may need an update for clarity.

### Canceling

**Canceling** your subscription is a permanent stop to your billing cycle. This action ends your plan’s credit refresh and future payments, but **your projects and documents remain accessible**. If you're on an annual plan, canceling is the only available option to end your subscription, as pausing is not supported. Keep in mind that you’ll need an active subscription to access any AI features—even if your documents are still viewable and exportable.

In short, pausing is a temporary suspension for monthly users, while canceling fully stops billing and renewals. Both actions preserve your work, but only an active plan enables continued use of Sudowrite’s AI tools.

We recognize that sometimes things come up that require special consideration! If you have questions about pausing or canceling your plan, please drop us a note at: [hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com)
