Sudowrite offers three subscription tiers—so whether you’re a hobbyist or a working professional, there’s an appropriate option for you. All plans have full access to _all_ of Sudowrite’s features. The difference between them is simply the number of credits included each month, and whether or not those credits expire.

The plans are:

-   **Hobby & Student:** 225,000 credits - Price: $10/mo (paid annually) or $19/mo (paid monthly)
    
-   **Professional:** 1,000,000 credits - Price: $22/mo (paid annually) or $29/mo (paid monthly)
    
-   **Max:** 2,000,000 _rollover_ credits - Price: $44/mo (paid annually) or $59/mo (paid monthly)
    

As outlined above, discounts are available to those who opt to subscribe annually rather than a monthly.
