# Project Progress - Documentation Orchestration System

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-15

## Overview

Building an AI-powered documentation orchestration system for Sudowrite that automatically detects when documentation needs updating after product changes.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Webhook Deployment (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Deploy webhook to Vercel that receives Featurebase changelog webhooks and triggers documentation audits.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Vercel Configuration** ✅
   - Created `vercel.json` with serverless function configuration
   - Configured Node.js runtime and routing
   - Set up environment variables (Featurebase, Anthropic, GitHub)

2. **Webhook Endpoint** ✅
   - Built `api/webhooks/changelog.js` - POST-only webhook handler
   - Accepts changelog data from Featurebase
   - Responds immediately (200 OK)
   - Triggers two-stage AI audit asynchronously

3. **Testing & Validation** ✅
   - Created `scripts/test-webhook.js` for local testing
   - Added `npm run test:webhook` command
   - Tested locally - webhook receives and processes correctly
   - Deployed to production at https://sw-docs-control.vercel.app
   - Tested live endpoint - working correctly

4. **Root URL Info Page** ✅ (Pending Deployment)
   - Created `api/index.js` - System info and documentation
   - Returns JSON with system status, endpoints, health checks
   - Updated `vercel.json` to route root to info handler
   - Ready to deploy (minor Vercel CLI issue with directory name)

5. **Documentation** ✅
   - `VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
   - `FEATUREBASE-WEBHOOK-SETUP.md` - Webhook configuration instructions
   - `DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md` - What was deployed and how it works
   - `DEPLOYMENT-NOTES.md` - Troubleshooting and workarounds
   - `ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md` - Design decisions and rationale
   - Updated `README.md` with deployment status

### Production URLs

- **Webhook Endpoint**: https://sw-docs-control.vercel.app/api/webhooks/changelog ✅
- **Root URL**: https://sw-docs-control.vercel.app (shows 404, will show info page after next deploy)

### How It Works

```
Featurebase Changelog Published
        ↓
Webhook POST → /api/webhooks/changelog
        ↓
Respond 200 OK (immediate)
        ↓
Two-Stage Audit (async):
  Stage 1: Keyword filtering → Top 20 articles
  Stage 2: Claude Haiku 4.5 → Deep analysis
        ↓
Results:
  - Audit log saved to sudowrite-documentation/.audits/
  - GitHub issues created (optional)
  - Affected articles identified with edit links
```

### Key Metrics

- **Cost**: ~$0.07 per audit (~$3.50/year for weekly changelogs)
- **Processing Time**: 10-30 seconds per audit
- **Accuracy**: Identifies 5+ affected articles (vs 2 in V1)
- **Context Reduction**: 52K words → 35K tokens (Stage 1 filtering)

### Next Steps for Phase 1

- [ ] Deploy info page changes (via Vercel dashboard or git push)
- [ ] Configure Featurebase webhook in their admin panel
- [ ] Test with real changelog publication
- [ ] Monitor first production audit

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Bidirectional Featurebase Sync (COMPLETE - CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED)

**Goal**: Build two-way sync between local git repository and Featurebase help center.

**Status Update (Jan 15, 2026)**: 🔥 **MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED**
- Fixed critical bug: Was only syncing 10 articles, now syncs all 71
- Fixed critical bug: Articles had no content, now extracts full HTML body
- Organized structure: Files now organized by collection folders
- Verified: All 71 articles synced with 480KB of content

### Completed Features

**Sync To Featurebase** (`npm run sync:to-featurebase`):
- ✅ Push local markdown changes to Featurebase articles
- ✅ Update article content via Featurebase API
- ✅ Handle metadata (title, slug, category, etc.)
- ✅ Track sync history and conflicts
- ✅ Create new articles if they don't exist remotely
- ✅ Skip unchanged articles (hash-based detection)
- ⚠️ **NOTE**: May need updates to work with new collection folder structure

**Sync From Featurebase V2** (`npm run sync:from-featurebase`):
- ✅ Pull ALL 71 articles from Featurebase (with `limit: 100`)
- ✅ Extract HTML body content and convert to markdown
- ✅ Organize by collection structure (12 collection folders)
- ✅ Use clean, readable filenames (write.md, characters.md, etc.)
- ✅ Create new local files for new articles
- ✅ Update existing local files
- ✅ Detect changes made in Featurebase
- ✅ Tested and verified working with production data

### Architecture Decisions Made

**ADR-005: Bidirectional Sync Strategy**
- Chosen: Bidirectional with conflict detection (not single source of truth)
- Both local and remote are equal peers

**ADR-006: Conflict Resolution**
- Last-write-wins based on timestamps
- Both versions saved to `sudowrite-documentation/.conflicts/`
- User can manually merge if needed
- All conflicts logged in sync state

**ADR-007: Sync Tracking**
- Track sync state in `sudowrite-documentation/.sync-state.json`
- Store content hashes for change detection
- Record sync history per article
- Log all conflicts with timestamps

**ADR-008: ID Mapping**
- Use Featurebase article ID in filename
- Pattern: `article-title-{featurebase-id}/article.md`
- No separate mapping database needed

### Files Created

- ✅ `lib/featurebase-sync.js` - Core sync logic (370 lines)
- ✅ `scripts/sync-to-featurebase.js` - Push script (240 lines)
- ✅ `scripts/sync-from-featurebase.js` - Pull script (235 lines)
- ✅ `SYNC-GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation (590 lines)
- ✅ `SYNC-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Design document (490 lines)

### How It Works

**Push Workflow:**
```
Local markdown files
        ↓
Scan and detect changes (SHA-256 hash)
        ↓
Compare with remote Featurebase
        ↓
Conflict detection (timestamp comparison)
        ↓
Push changed articles
        ↓
Update sync state
```

**Pull Workflow:**
```
Featurebase articles
        ↓
Fetch via API
        ↓
Compare with local files
        ↓
Conflict detection (timestamp comparison)
        ↓
Create/update local markdown
        ↓
Update sync state
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
```
Both sides changed
        ↓
Compare timestamps
        ↓
Use newer version (last-write-wins)
        ↓
Save both versions to conflicts/
        ↓
Log conflict in sync state
        ↓
User can manually merge later
```

### Testing Status

- ✅ **TESTED** with production data on Jan 15, 2026
- ✅ Full sync completed successfully
- ✅ All 71 articles synced with content
- ✅ Collection structure verified
- ✅ Content extraction tested and working
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

### Current State (Jan 15, 2026)

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/mcstew/sw-docs-control
- Latest commit: `7f8d55c` - "Fix Featurebase sync: Pull ALL articles with full content"
- 66 files changed, 4,315 insertions
- All documentation now on GitHub with proper structure

**Local Structure**:
```

```

### Critical Issues Fixed

**Issue 1: Only 10 Articles Syncing**
- **Problem**: API missing `limit` parameter, defaulted to 10
- **Solution**: Added `limit: 100` to API call
- **Result**: Now syncs all 71 articles

**Issue 2: No Content in Articles**
- **Problem**: Looking for `content` field, but Featurebase uses `body` (HTML)
- **Solution**: Created `extractArticleContent()` to extract body and convert HTML→Markdown
- **Result**: All articles now have full content (480KB total)

**Issue 3: No Collection Organization**
- **Problem**: Flat file structure, hard to navigate
- **Solution**: Organized into collection folders matching Featurebase structure
- **Result**: 12 collection folders with clean filenames

### Next Steps

**Immediate (Before Next Session)**:
1. ✅ Document what was fixed (see SYNC-FIX-NOTES.md)
2. ✅ Update PROGRESS.md with current state
3. ⏸️ Ready for testing bidirectional workflow

**Testing Needed**:
1. **Test Edit in Featurebase → Sync to Local**:
   - Edit an article in Featurebase UI
   - Run `npm run sync:from-featurebase`
   - Verify changes appear locally
   - Commit to GitHub

2. **Test Edit Locally → Sync to Featurebase**:
   - Edit a local markdown file
   - Run `npm run sync:to-featurebase` (may need updates)
   - Verify changes appear in Featurebase UI

3. **Test Conflict Resolution**:
   - Edit same article in both places
   - Run sync and verify conflict detection works
   - Check `.conflicts/` folder for backups

**Improvements Needed**:
- [ ] Update `sync-to-featurebase.js` to work with collection folders
- [ ] Test full bidirectional workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Add cursor-based pagination for 100+ articles (if needed)
- [ ] Handle image downloads (optional - CDN URLs work fine)

## 📋 Phase 3: Web UI for Review (NOT STARTED)

**Goal**: Build web interface for reviewing and approving AI audit suggestions.

### Scope

**Dashboard**:
- List recent audits
- Show affected articles per audit
- Display audit status (pending/approved/rejected)

**Review Interface**:
- Show AI suggestions side-by-side with current content
- Approve/reject individual suggestions
- Edit suggestions before applying
- Bulk approve/reject

**Manual Editing**:
- Edit articles directly in UI
- Preview changes
- Commit to git or push to Featurebase

### Technology Decisions Needed

1. **Framework**
   - Next.js (already in dependencies)? ✅
   - Separate React SPA?
   - Server-side or client-side rendering?

2. **Authentication**
   - Who can access the UI?
   - Password? OAuth? IP allowlist?

3. **Data Storage**
   - Where to store audit state (approved/rejected)?
   - Git? Database? Vercel KV?

4. **Deployment**
   - Same Vercel project? ✅
   - Add pages/ directory to existing deployment

### Files to Create

- [ ] `pages/index.js` - Dashboard
- [ ] `pages/review/[auditId].js` - Review interface
- [ ] `pages/api/audits/[auditId].js` - Audit API
- [ ] `pages/api/approve.js` - Approval endpoint
- [ ] `components/` - React components
- [ ] `WEB-UI-GUIDE.md` - Documentation

### Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **Root URL Deployment**
   - Changes committed but not deployed
   - Vercel CLI issue with directory name containing space
   - Workaround: Deploy via dashboard or git push

2. **Audit Logs in Git**
   - Currently committing audit JSON files to git
   - May want to gitignore or move to external storage
   - Decision: Keep for now, revisit if repo size grows

3. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Currently manual via Vercel CLI
   - Could improve with helper script
   - Script exists: `scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh`

4. **No Webhook Security**
   - Webhook accepts any POST request
   - Should add Featurebase webhook secret verification
   - Low priority (Featurebase is trusted source)

## 📋 Future Migrations & Planned Changes

### Documentation URL Migration

**When Featurebase docs move to docs.sudowrite.com:**

1. Update base URL in `scripts/generate-rollups.js` (line 61):
   ```javascript
   // Change from:
   const baseUrl = 'https://feedback.sudowrite.com/help';
   
   // To:
   const baseUrl = 'https://docs.sudowrite.com';
   ```

2. Regenerate knowledge files:
   ```bash
   npm run generate:rollups
   ```

3. Commit and push the updated files:
   ```bash
   git add llms.txt docs-rollup.md scripts/generate-rollups.js
   git commit -m "Update documentation URLs to docs.sudowrite.com"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Current state (as of 2026-01-21):**
- Featurebase docs currently live at: `https://feedback.sudowrite.com/help`
- llms.txt URLs point to this location
- Helpkit (Notion-based) docs still at: `https://docs.sudowrite.com`
- When migration complete, update baseUrl to point to new Featurebase location
